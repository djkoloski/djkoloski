A large portion of this text is dedicated to explaining and understanding the properties of impl Trait, but it is not solely an explainer.\n\nIf you're already familiar with the properties and mechanics of impl Trait, you can skip to the next post.\nIf you want to read the past work done on impl Trait, you can skip to the third post.\nIf you're ready for the final proposal, you can skip to the fourth post.\n\nI believe that the current implementation of impl Trait is confusing and non-orthogonal. I propose an alternative formulation of impl Trait that is more intuitive, restores orthogonality to the feature, and enables more precise and flexible use of abstraction.\nWhat is impl Trait?\nimpl Trait is syntax sugar can be used in argument position or in return position. Let's look at how it can be used and how it desugars to more fundamental Rust syntax.\nArgument position\nWhen used in argument position, impl Trait is shorthand for a type that implements the requested traits. It takes a function like:\nfn log(x: impl Debug) {\n    dbg!(x);\n}\n\nAnd desugars it to:\nfn log&lt;X: Debug&gt;(x: X) {\n    dbg!(x);\n}\n\nIn argument position, each impl Trait is assumed to be a different, unique type. If we wanted to take two arguments of the same type, we couldn't use impl Trait any more and would have to be more explicit. This doesn't compile:\nfn pick(which: bool, x: impl Debug, y: impl Debug) -&gt; impl Debug {\n    if !which {\n        x\n    } else {\n        y\n    }\n}\n\nWith this error:\nerror[E0308]: `if` and `else` have incompatible types\n= note:        expected type `impl Debug`\n        found type parameter `impl Debug`\n= note: a type parameter was expected, but a different one was found\n\nThis is because x's impl Debug could be a different concrete type from y's impl Debug. impl Trait makes them appear to be the same type when they really aren't. Instead, we write:\nfn pick&lt;T: Debug&gt;(which: bool, x: T, y: T) -&gt; T {\n    ...\n}\n\nWhich tells the compiler that we expect two of the same type and will return that type. That's easy enough, we just have to desugar it ourselves and give the compiler a little more information. Let's move on.\nReturn position\nWhen used in return position, impl Traits is also shorthand for a type that implements the requested traits. However, there's a catch. It takes a function like this:\nfn target() -&gt; impl Debug {\n    \"hello world\"\n}\n\nAnd desugars it to something like this:\nstruct Target&lt;T: Debug + ?Sized&gt;(T);\n\nimpl&lt;T: Debug + ?Sized&gt; Debug for Target&lt;T&gt; {\n    fn fmt(&amp;self, f: &amp;mut Formatter&lt;'_&gt;) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt; {\n        self.0.fmt(f)\n    }\n}\n\nfn target() -&gt; Target&lt;&amp;'static str&gt; {\n    Target(\"hello world\")\n}\n\nThis desugaring has a special property: the return type &amp;'static str gets abstracted behind an opaque Target&lt;T&gt; wrapper. That lets target limit what properties of its return type a caller is allowed to rely on. In this case, the Target type proxies the Debug impl but only the Debug impl. Any other traits implemented by the wrapped T are not implemented by Target&lt;T&gt;1. Let's look at a more complex example to see how this affects composability:\nfn combine&lt;T: Add&gt;(lhs: T, rhs: T) -&gt; T::Output {\n    lhs.add(rhs)\n}\n\nprintln!(\"{}\", combine(1, 2));\nprintln!(\"{:?}\", combine(1, 2));\n\nWithout impl Trait, the return type of combine is just a T::Output. That means that combine(1, 2) returns a plain i32, so we can take advantage of i32's Display and Debug implementations. Let's compare that to what happens when we use impl Trait:\nfn combine_abstract&lt;T: Add&gt;(lhs: T, rhs: T) -&gt; impl Display\nwhere\n    T::Output: Display,\n{\n    lhs.add(rhs)\n}\n\nprintln!(\"{}\", combine_abstract(1, 2));\n// ERROR: `impl Display` does not implement `Debug`\nprintln!(\"{:?}\", combine_abstract(1, 2));\n\nNow we have abstracted our return type using impl Trait, and that opaque return type does not implement Debug. Note that we also had to bound T::Output: Display since our impl Debug requires that the value inside of it implements Debug. While we can still Display the return value of combine_abstract, we can no longer Debug it. That's the very literal difference when using impl Trait, but what does that actually mean for our code?\nShould you abstract your types?\nAn abstract type restricts what someone else can know about a concrete type. In the fn target() -&gt; &amp;'static str example, whoever calls target gets an unabstracted &amp;'static str. This can be both a blessing and a curse:\nThe good\nOn one hand, a concrete type lets you reason about its other properties. In this example, we wrap our input in a type and return it concretely:\n#[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]\npub struct Container&lt;T&gt;(T);\n\npub fn contain&lt;T&gt;(value: T) -&gt; Container&lt;T&gt; {\n    Container(value)\n}\n\nprintln!(\"{:?}\", contain(\"hello world\"));\n\nBecause contain returns Container concretely, we can determine whether the return value implements a trait. T implements Debug, and Container implements it if T does, so we can debug print the return value from contain. This lets us write contain to be as helpful as possible to whoever calls it.\nThe bad\nBut what if, some time in the future, we want to change Container so that it no longer implements PartialEq:\n#[derive(Debug)]\npub struct Container&lt;T&gt;(T);\n\nPerhaps that was just for debugging and nobody was supposed to rely on PartialEq being implemented. But Container is public since it's the return type of contain, so we've broken everyone who was relying on PartialEq being implemented! This situation gets worse for auto traits like Send and Sync since we might change whether our type implements an auto trait just by changing its definition. That's spooky action at a distance!\nThis is a situation where impl Trait can help us. By returning an impl Debug, we can prevent Hyrum's Law from breaking everything downstream from our library when we remove the Debug implementation:\npub fn contain&lt;T: Debug&gt;(value: T) -&gt; impl Debug {\n    Container(value)\n}\n\nprintln!(\"{:?}\", contain(\"hello world\"));\n\nNow our downstream users can't rely on any additional traits being implemented, and we can add and remove more trait implementations from Container without causing a semver breakage.\nThese examples have all been for free functions and inherent methods; what's the situation for traits?\nimpl Trait in traits\nArgument position (traits)\nNot much is different for argument position impl Trait in trait methods. Something like this:\ntrait Logger {\n    fn log(x: impl Debug);\n}\n\ndesugars to:\ntrait Logger {\n    fn log&lt;X: Debug&gt;(x: X);\n}\n\nThis is pretty much the same as the previous argument position desugaring. But what about...\nReturn position (traits)\nYou can't use impl Trait in return position right now, but why is that? Let's consider a desugaring of impl Trait as a return type in a trait:\ntrait Miner {\n    fn mine() -&gt; impl Ore;\n}\n\nA straightforward desugaring of this would be:\ntrait Miner {\n    type Mine: Ore;\n    fn mine() -&gt; Self::Mine;\n}\n\nBut that doesn't abstract the return type like we want. Instead, we should make a wrapper to hide the details of the concrete type:\nstruct MinerOre&lt;T: Ore&gt;(T);\n\nimpl&lt;T: Ore&gt; Ore for MinerOre&lt;T&gt; { ... }\n\ntrait Miner {\n    type Mine: Ore;\n    fn mine() -&gt; MinerOre&lt;Self::Mine&gt;;\n}\n\nThis seems sensible, now let's implement a Miner with our chosen desugaring:\nstruct Quarry;\n\nimpl Miner for Quarry {\n    fn mine() -&gt; impl Ore {\n        Bauxite\n    }\n}\n\nThis desugars to:\nstruct Quarry;\n\nimpl Miner for Quarry {\n    type Mine = Bauxite;\n    fn mine() -&gt; MinerOre&lt;Self::Mine&gt; {\n        MinerOre(Bauxite)\n    }\n}\n\nThat makes sense, but I'm left a little dissatisfied. The trait is dictating whether the return type of the function is abstract, but we could let the impl choose whether to abstract its return type. The impl is the one exposing that associated Mine type, so we could just set type Mine = MinerOre&lt;Bauxite&gt; instead. Let's consider an alternative desugaring:\nReturn position (traits, version 2)\nLet's change our original desugaring for our trait:\ntrait Miner {\n    fn mine() -&gt; impl Ore;\n}\n\nSo that it now desugars to:\ntrait Miner {\n    type Mine: Ore;\n    fn mine() -&gt; Self::Mine;\n}\n\nNote that this is more consistent with how the argument position impl Trait desugars, let's keep that in mind. Anyway, now our Miner impl is:\nstruct Quarry;\n\nimpl Miner for Quarry {\n    fn mine() -&gt; impl Ore {\n        Bauxite\n    }\n}\n\nWhich desugars to:\nstruct Quarry;\n\nstruct QuarryOre&lt;T: Ore&gt;(T);\n\nimpl&lt;T: Ore&gt; Ore for QuarryOre&lt;T&gt; { ... }\n\nimpl Miner for Quarry {\n    type Mine = QuarryOre&lt;Bauxite&gt;;\n    fn mine() -&gt; Self::Mine {\n        QuarryOre(Bauxite)\n    }\n}\n\nAnd now it's the impl that decides whether to abstract the return type. Nice, but the syntax seems a little weird. If we chose not to abstract our return type, the trait and impl look like this instead:\ntrait Miner {\n    fn mine() -&gt; impl Ore;\n}\n\nstruct Quarry;\n\nimpl Miner for Quarry {\n    type Mine = Bauxite;\n    fn mine() -&gt; Self::Mine {\n        Bauxite\n    }\n}\n\nThere's no associated type in the trait definition, but we still need it to write our unabstracted trait implementation. So we end up conjuring the associated Mine type out of thin air. This is because the impl Ore in our Miner trait actually desugars to a concrete associated Mine type. This is good because we want the implementor to choose whether to abstract their return type. However, impl Trait now means different things in different contexts.\n\nIn a trait definition, impl Trait is just sugar for an associated type bounded by some trait. This is similar to how impl Trait in argument position is just sugar for generics. This desugaring does not abstract the return type.\nIn a trait implementation, impl Trait does abstract the return type like we would expect.\n\nThis desugaring does everything we want at the cost of having some very unintuitive behavior around the secret associated type. In our first desugaring, the one that didn't let the implementor choose whether to abstract the return type, impl Trait had syntactic consistency at the cost of flexibility. This new desugaring makes the opposite tradeoff.\nFlipping it around\nWe can also have the reverse problem if a trait returns an associated type but an implementation wants to abstract its return value:\ntrait Miner {\n    type Mine: Ore;\n    fn mine() -&gt; Self::Mine;\n}\n\nstruct Quarry;\n\nimpl Miner for Quarry {\n    type Mine = ???;\n    fn mine() -&gt; impl Ore {\n        Bauxite\n    }\n}\n\nSince we can no longer tell Mine what type it is. We could move the impl Ore into the type definition:\nimpl Miner for Quarry {\n    type Mine = impl Ore;\n    fn mine() -&gt; Self::Mine { ... }\n}\n\nAnd in fact, this is what the Type Alias Impl Trait (TAIT) proposal suggests. But now the type of Mine is being inferred from the body of mine. This can lead to confusion:\nimpl Miner for Quarry {\n    type Mine = impl Ore;\n    fn mine() -&gt; Self::Mine {\n        Bauxite; // &lt;-- Oops! A stray semicolon!\n    }\n}\n\nIf Ore is implemented for the unit type (), then our code will compile fine but do the wrong thing. We won't know about it until runtime, if we even catch it. Additionally, it's important to note that we would have avoided this if we specified type Mine = Bauxite instead of using impl Trait.\nThis is a specific case, but with more complex expressions we can cause much sneakier issues2. This issue can occur anywhere that infer the return types of functions, and is really a problem with return position impl Trait as a whole. What we're doing here is allowing these issues to creep into new places in the language as well, increasing the odds that we'll accidentally stumble across it.\nMeta: who cares?\nIs this really so bad though? For many people this will be a mild annoyance, but one that they can live with. Maybe the compiler errors will be a little vague, maybe a few screwball types will get mixed up but caught in unit tests. It's very tempting to never publish these posts, never start any debate, never pitch dumb issues like these back and forth on Github. Who am I really to stand in the way of progress? I don't want to go back to a language where nothing improves or changes or ever gets done.\nI see this as a papercut. It's an unsettling reminder of the weird behavior I'd see in C++, where these kinds of issues kept getting added and expanded over multiple language revisions. Eventually, it got so bad that you were not just able but likely to die by a thousand papercuts. You could only write so much code before one of them would get you.\nI don't think we have to choose between having footguns and being able to use impl Trait. Unfortunately, we're also steaming ahead in implementing and stabilizing all of these features. I don't think that's a bad thing, I admire that as a project we're able to make real progress on new features and improvements. I just think this is a moment for us to take pause and consider some alternatives.\nConclusion\nAlright, so we've got some problems. In part 2, I'll describe one possible solution to this problem that allows us to have both consistency and flexibility.\n1 impl Trait actually does leak some traits, specifically auto traits. Auto traits are automatically implemented for types based on their compositions, so the Target struct in our example will implement them if T does. This has led to a now-famous tweet. I'd like to add that impl Trait also leaks Unpin because it is an auto trait like Send and Sync.2 Consider this code that uses TAIT and GATs:\n#![feature(type_alias_impl_trait)]\n#![feature(generic_associated_types)]\n\ntrait Miner {\n    type Mine&lt;'a&gt; where Self: 'a;\n    fn mine(&amp;self) -&gt; Self::Mine&lt;'_&gt;;\n}\n\ntrait Ore: Clone {\n    fn print(&amp;self);\n}\n\nimpl&lt;T: Ore&gt; Ore for &amp;T {\n    fn print(&amp;self) { println!(\"Ore\"); }\n}\n\n#[derive(Clone, Copy)]\nstruct Bauxite;\n\nimpl Ore for Bauxite {\n    fn print(&amp;self) { println!(\"Bauxite\"); }\n}\n\nstruct Quarry&lt;T&gt; {\n    ore: T,\n}\n\nimpl&lt;T&gt; Quarry&lt;T&gt; {\n    fn ore(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;T {\n        &amp;self.ore\n    }\n}\n\nimpl&lt;T: 'static + Ore&gt; Miner for Quarry&lt;T&gt; {\n    type Mine&lt;'a&gt; = impl Ore;\n    fn mine(&amp;self) -&gt; Self::Mine&lt;'_&gt; {\n        self.ore().clone()\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let quarry = Quarry { ore: Bauxite };\n    quarry.mine().print();\n}\n\nIf you've written any async code using GATs and TAIT then you may find this kind of code eerily familiar. This prints Bauxite like we expect, but if we remove the : Clone supertrait from Ore (maybe during some refactoring) then it prints Ore instead. This issue isn't totally unique to TAIT though, it can also happen in stable Rust:\ntrait Ore: Clone {\n    fn print(&amp;self);\n}\n\nimpl&lt;T: Ore&gt; Ore for &amp;T {\n    fn print(&amp;self) { println!(\"Ore\"); }\n}\n\n#[derive(Clone, Copy)]\nstruct Bauxite;\n\nimpl Ore for Bauxite {\n    fn print(&amp;self) { println!(\"Bauxite\"); }\n}\n\nstruct Quarry&lt;T&gt; {\n    ore: T,\n}\n\nimpl&lt;T: Ore&gt; Quarry&lt;T&gt; {\n    fn ore(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;T {\n        &amp;self.ore\n    }\n\n    fn mine(&amp;self) -&gt; impl Ore + '_ {\n        self.ore().clone()\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let quarry = Quarry { ore: Bauxite };\n    quarry.mine().print();\n}\n\nIn this case it's only for free functions, and you'd probably find the presence of impl Ore + '_ a bit more suspicious. What TAIT does is allow this problem cross the trait boundary. Traits are no longer safe from this mistake because this is really a problem with return position impl Trait and TAIT enables return position impl Trait in traits.","id":"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/a-new-impl-trait-1/","title":"A new impl Trait 1/4"},"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/a-new-impl-trait-2/":{"body":"Where we left off\nIn part 1, we explored some possibilities for desugaring impl Trait in return position. In this post, I will explore these possibilities more fully and try to discover the logical implications of them. If you're feeling goal-oriented, you can skip to the next post where I discuss prior art and compare my proposal against it.\nLet's start far away from desugarings; we'll wander back there soon enough. For the time being, we'll also use standard desugarings for impl Trait. To start, let's talk about...\nAbstract return types\nI've got some odd code. Let's take a look:\nfn generate&lt;T&gt;(value: T) -&gt; impl FnOnce() -&gt; T {\n    move || value\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // This works\n    let eighteen = || 18;\n    let also_eighteen = eighteen.clone();\n\n    // This doesn't?\n    let forty_two = generate(42);\n    let also_forty_two = forty_two.clone();\n}\n\ngenerate is a function that accepts a value and returns a closure that returns that value. Well technically, it really returns an impl FnOnce() -&gt; T which is an abstract type. In fact, because it's a closure, the only way we can return it is with impl Trait. We can't refer to the type of the closure by name, so it can't be used as a concrete type. That's not a problem unless we want to leverage some of its concrete properties. However, closures already have some properties that we may want to take advantage of:\n\nClosure types: All closure types implement Sized. Additionally, closure types implement the following traits if allowed to do so by the types of the captures it stores:\n\nClone\nCopy\nSync\nSend\n\n\nSized, Sync, and Send are all auto-traits. For complicated reasons, we'll ignore these for now and focus on Clone.\nBecause we're returning our closure abstracted, we can't leak whether our closure implements Clone back to the caller. And we can't return our closure unabstracted, so we're stuck. The closure that we made locally can be cloned because it's not abstracted, but as soon as it's returned by a function we can no longer clone it!\nWe could do something like this:\nfn generate_cloneable&lt;T: Clone&gt;(value: T) -&gt; impl (Clone + FnOnce() -&gt; T) {\n    move || value\n}\n\nBut now we have two copies of generate, and anything that calls it will also need two copies. And so on and so forth. That's pretty inconvenient, but in all fairness, it could be worse.\nIt could be worse\nPresumably, new traits will be added to the standard library over time. Maybe some of them will be useful enough that closures will implement them, much like they do for Clone right now. For now, let's say that we've decided to implement Debug for closures. That would be cool, now people can for example check what variables are captured by a closure. In this future, we've just created a huge headache for everyone who wants to return one of them.\nTo cover all the possible use cases, it's no longer suitable to have two copies of a function with different return types. Now, we need four copies:\n\nimpl Fn() -&gt; T\nClone + impl Fn() -&gt; T\nDebug + impl Fn() -&gt; T\nClone + Debug + impl Fn() -&gt; T\n\nAnd four copies of whatever calls those, and so on. That's not sustainable. In a technical sense, we're already here since closures eagerly implement both Clone and Copy. If we want to return a closure that may implement either of these, we need different functions that all return different impl Traits.\nChanging return types\nLet's pretend that we can return our closure as a concrete type, for example by using type inference. This could be done by putting a _ in return position:\nfn generate_cloneable&lt;T: Clone&gt;(value: T) -&gt; _ {\n    move || value\n}\n\nWith an unabstracted return type, we can leak our implemented traits! Now we only need one copy of our closure-returning function. However, there's nowhere in our function signature that we're guaranteeing that our return type is... well anything. This isn't great because we might accidentally change our return type by changing our function body, breaking our semver compatibility without realizing it. Maybe if we had a type alias, we could add some where clauses?\ntype MyClosure&lt;T&gt; = _;\n\nfn generate_cloneable&lt;T: Clone&gt;(value: T) -&gt; MyClosure&lt;T&gt;\nwhere\n    MyClosure&lt;T&gt;: FnOnce() -&gt; T,\n{\n    move || value\n}\n\nWe know that MyClosure is actually the type of move || value, but nobody else who glances at our source code will know that. It's not in our function signature, it's not at the alias declaration site, it's all inferred from our surroundings. And yet, we're now exposing the concrete properties of our closure to everyone. It's a recipe for server violations.\nSome of these cases could be mitigated by linting. Places where type inference is used in return position, but the return type can be named. That would keep impl Trait just for cases where we want to abstract the return type and type inference just for cases where we can't name the type.\nBefore we put these ideas together into a coherent proposal, I'd like to address some solutions we already have:\nRPITIT and TAIT\nIn the last post, we looked at \"Return position impl Trait in traits\" (RPITIT) and \"Type alias impl Trait\" (TAIT). To be clear, I don't think either of these proposals are bad. I just think they miss the mark, and it's not their fault. Here's why:\nWhen we desugar return position impl Trait, it gets hidden in a wrapper type and that type is abstract. In fact, that type is an abstraction over the concrete type. I argue that we're missing that extra informaiton, and that is leading us down the path of type inference. Instead of declaring our type aliases and leveraging those for inference, we instead have to declare our alias and then be painfully specific everywhere that we use it:\n#![feature(type_alias_impl_trait)]\n\nuse ::core::{fmt::Debug, ptr::null};\n\ntype Handle = impl Debug;\n\nfn a() -&gt; Handle {\n    null::&lt;i32&gt;()\n}\n\nfn b() -&gt; Handle {\n    null()\n}\n\nIf you thought that this would compile, I don't blame you! We should have all the information we need to deduce that Integer is an abstract pointer to an i32. However, that's not what we get:\nerror[E0282]: type annotations needed\n  --&gt; src/lib.rs:12:5\n   |\n12 |     null()\n   |     ^^^^ cannot infer type for type parameter `T` declared on the function `null`\n\nThis is because we're inferring the type of Integer, and we don't want to accidentally infer the wrong type in a situation where we're actually confused. Compare this to a concrete type alias:\n#![feature(type_alias_impl_trait)]\n\nuse ::core::ptr::null;\n\ntype Handle = *const i32;\n\nfn null_handle() -&gt; Handle {\n    null()\n}\n\nIn this situation, we can infer the type arguments to null() and don't have to use a turbofish to specify that it's specifically null::&lt;i32&gt;(). This reversal of the inference flow strikes me as ripe for confusing errors and unintuitive type inference problems.\nMy proposal\nI propose that we introduce new syntax for performing type abstraction. Instead of focusing on the call site, this will instead directly abstract a given concrete type. The goal of this proposal is to separate the broadly-useful type abstraction of impl Trait from the narrowly-useful type inference of impl Trait. As I mentioned earlier, separating these two features would allow us to use abstracted types freely while still preventing the use of inferred types unless they are absolutely necessary (i.e. for unnameable types).\nas impl Trait\nConsider this new syntax:\nfn foo() -&gt; &amp;'static str as impl Debug {\n    \"hello world\"\n}\n\nThis new syntax would desugar to:\nstruct ImplDebug&lt;T: Debug&gt;(T);\n\nimpl&lt;T: Debug&gt; Debug for ImplDebug&lt;T&gt; {\n    fn fmt(&amp;self, f: &amp;mut Formatter&lt;'_&gt;) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt; {\n        self.0.fmt(f)\n    }\n}\n\nfn foo() -&gt; ImplDebug&lt;&amp;'static str&gt; {\n    ImplDebug(\"hello world\")\n}\n\nIn this situation, as impl Trait would serve as the site where the abstracted type is generated. This gives us more control over when these wrappers are created and allows us to guarantee that multiple functions return the same abstracted type.\nThis also allows abstract types to be used anywhere a regular type would be, and not just in return position. It would separate the type abstraction of impl Trait in return position from the type inference of it in argument position and help solve a number of outstanding problems with type abstraction.\nLet's take a look at how this would apply to RPITIT and TAIT.\nReturn position impl trait in trait (RPITIT)\nAssociated types of traits leak concrete types. Someone might use &lt;MyFoo as Foo&gt;::Bar somewhere that it needs to be Debug, and the compiler will let them do it as long as the constraints check out. But that's not part of our contract, and nobody should be allowed to depend on the fact that MyBar implements Debug if we don't want them to. So what if we could say something like this instead:\ntrait Transformer&lt;T&gt; {\n    type Output;\n    fn transform(x: &amp;T) -&gt; Self::Output;\n}\n\nimpl&lt;T: Clone&gt; Transformer&lt;T&gt; for Replicator {\n    type Output = T as impl Clone;\n    fn transform(x: &amp;T) -&gt; Self::Cloned {\n        x.clone()\n    }\n}\n\nNow, the associated T type isn't T, it's an abstraction of T. It's an abstraction that only exposes the fact that T implements Clone, which is exactly what we want.\nType alias impl trait (TAIT)\nA new approach to TAIT would look like this instead:\nuse ::core::{fmt::Debug, ptr::null};\n\ntype Handle = *const i32 as impl Debug;\n\nfn a() -&gt; Handle {\n    null()\n}\n\nfn b() -&gt; Handle {\n    null()\n}\n\nThis time, everything checks out. We know that Handle is not just any impl Debug, it's specifically *const i32 as impl Debug. That allows us to use type inference everywhere; we don't even need to turbofish in a() this time. And to cap it all off, we still get an abstracted type to hide any trait implementations we want to keep private.\nPublicly abstracted private types\nimpl Trait already allows us to expose private types through impl Trait, but now we can go a step further:\nstruct Thought;\npub struct Brain;\n\nimpl Factory for Brain {\n    type Output = Thought as impl Display;\n    fn produce() -&gt; Self::Output {\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\nNote that Thought is private, yet we're exposing it through an abstraction in our associated type. This makes it possible for us to swap out the concrete type of &lt;Brain as Factory&gt;::Output without it being a breaking change! Thought was private and inaccessible, and so we could remove it entirely without causing any semver violations.\nClarity and concreteness\nBecause the concrete type of the abstraction is preserved, we can still reason about and use the concrete underlying type. If we wanted to, we could even provide the same type abstracted in some places, and unabstracted in others. We could easily abstract types we didn't make, and use concrete types internally while still exposing them as abstracted externally. And most importantly, the abstracted return types do not depend on the bodies of our functions. We can modify the code however we want and the compiler will prevent us from accidentally modifying our return types.\nType inference\nThis leaves us with one final issue to tackle: how to return unnameable type. Think back to our closure example:\nfn generate&lt;T&gt;(value: T) -&gt; ?? as impl FnOnce() -&gt; T {\n    move || value\n}\n\nWe've dug ourselves a hole. One of the primary use cases of impl Trait was to avoid having to name our closure type. But in order to use as impl Trait, we need to do exactly that. This is a situation where we'd have to reach for type inference and write _ as impl FnOnce() -&gt; T, which exposes us to the problems of type inference. Now, it's just on a very small scale since it's just for closures and async blocks. But there's a - still not perfect - but better way...\nName the unnameable\nWhy couldn't we just give that closure a name? Maybe something like:\nfn generate&lt;T&gt;(value: T) -&gt; type 'A as impl FnOnce() -&gt; T {\n    'A: move || value\n}\n\nSo here's some more new syntax. Similarly to how we label loops, we can label the creation sites of unnameable types. That way, we can uniquely refer to them in other places. This would solve both of our outstanding problems:\n\nWith a label, we can now refer to our closure in our signature as type 'A.\nAdditionally, we can leave off the as impl Trait to return our closure concretely. This solves our earlier problem of returning a closure that may be Clone, and avoids having to use unrestricted type inference (i.e. -&gt; _).\n\nReturning the closure concretely sould be as simple as:\nfn generate&lt;T&gt;(value: T) -&gt; type 'A {\n    'A: move || value\n}\n\nI'm not married to the syntax. It's functional, but I don't think it's great. I'll talk more about this and type inference in later posts.\nConclusion\nIn the first post, I stated that I would propose an alternative formulation of impl Trait that restores orthogonality. That comes in two parts:\n\nas impl Trait now handles only type abstraction. Unnameable types like closures and async blocks use their own syntax to be named.\ntype 'A labels for unnameable types enable them to be returned concretely and abstracted cleanly. This is an alternative to type inference, but either will complement as impl Trait and get the job done.\n\nNeither of these ideas are new, they have been discussed and considered before. However, I think we now have the experience necessary to fix our past mistakes and a growing need for these more general tools.\nIn the third post, I'll discuss existing proposals and prior art and compare my proposal against them.\n","id":"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/a-new-impl-trait-2/","title":"A new impl Trait 2/4"},"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/a-new-impl-trait-3/":{"body":"If you're not interested in reading about the prior work done on impl Trait, feel free to skip ahead to the fourth and final post.\nPrior work\nThe concepts behind impl Trait have been around for a surprisingly long time. I've done my best to collect relevant RFCs, successful and failed, review them and compare them to my proposal. There are five RFCs that are directly relevant to impl Trait and type abstraction. Let's go in chronological order.\nThe original impl Trait\nThe first impl Trait RFC from @aturon was not accepted, but a proposed more conservative version of it was accepted.\nIn many ways, this RFC has the same goals as my recommendation. Specifically, it addresses the following by name:\n\nReturning unboxed closures - this now also applies to unboxed Futures generated by async blocks\nPreventing leaky APIs - this is related to trait leakage when returning unabstracted types, one of the problems that we're trying to solve\nSimplifying complex types - the given example is heavily-composed iterator types\nDocumentation - namely making it easier to understand complex return types\n\nIt even proposed allowing impl Trait in any type position, which as impl Trait also aims to allow. Thare are places in the thread where as impl Trait is even used, albeit in the context of a value. So why was the more conservative version accepted instead of the original?\nimpl Trait anywhere\nThe original proposal didn't have a concrete use-case for impl Trait outside of function signatures. With a more current need for TAIT, I would say that we now have a motivating use case for it.\nNamed return types\nThe original proposal suggested syntax like collect_to_set::&lt;T, I&gt;::impl to refer to the impl Trait return type of the function collect_to_set. This raised questions about how to refer to nested return types. as impl Trait does not have this problem, since the correct approach in this case would be to separate the return type into a type alias. It is good to question how named unnameable types interact with distant type aliases though and whether this would be an issue. Nested as impl Traits can be approached in the same way.\nTrait object confusion\nThere was a lot of concern that it would be easy to confuse impl Trait (a statically-dispatched abstract type) with Trait. At the time, Trait was the syntax for trait objects. It has since been replaced with dyn Trait and deprecated, so the risk of confusion is lower now than ever. Additionally, I think that Type as impl Trait conveys a much larger difference from dyn Trait than impl Trait does.\nimpl Trait is not powerful enough\nimpl Trait was proposed as being a very general-purpose equivalent of existential types, which as impl Trait does not. There was some reluctance to having two ways to express the same concept, which isn't as much of a problem with as impl Trait.\nCoupled sugarings\n@pnkfelix actually calls this out explicitly in a comment, how impl Trait has two different uses depending on whether it's used in argument position or return position. There's also discussion about how covariant and contravariant appearances of impl Trait have different desugarings, and even a suggestion that some Trait be introduced to capture that notion. This parallels a lot of what was discussed in the first post.\nLeaky auto traits\nThis was a controversial aspect at the time, but it's now well-known that abstractions leak auto traits. This hasn't changed, and the previous discussion is extensive and not worth rehashing.\nConclusion\nAt the end of it all, @aturon closed the RFC in favor of working towards some alternatives with other interested members.\nThis first RFC does somewhat of a whirlwind tour of the problems that impl Trait attempts to solve. Existential types made an appearance, conditional trait bounds showed up, and there was speculative syntax galore. It properly sets the stage for:\nConservative impl Trait\nThis RFC is essentially just a limited version of the original proposal. It only allows impl Trait in argument and return position on free and inherent functions. Unfortunately, there's not much to comment on here since it's a subset of the previous RFC. Some notes:\nAbstract vs anonymous\nThere are a few places here where the terminology around these types are questioned. I prefer \"abstract\" to draw a clearer separation between abstracted types and unnameable types, both of which could be confused as \"anonymous\" by non-experts (sorry @eddyb!).\nNamed output types\n@eddyb suggests naming the return types of functions, which is very similar to my suggestion for named unnameable types. Even down to the use of the type keyword, which was fun to see. Naming the return types of functions alone would make it possible to do everything that type alias as impl Trait can do, but using it in conjunction with type aliases would give us incredibly comfy ergonomics.\nAnxiety of impl Trait overuse\nThe downsides of impl Trait are known, and a few people pointed out that encouraging the use of impl Trait in more places could lead to undesirable situations. We discussed this problem when we talked about whether we want our trait implementations to leak, and I think that as impl Trait alleviates many of these concerns by preserving the concrete type information.\nBikeshedding: impl vs type\nThere seem to be some strong opinions about which syntax would be better. impl Trait won evidently.\nAn unclear future for impl Trait\nA really poignant critique of the RFC was that the original failed because many people wanted different futures for it. This RFC was effectively just the lowest common denominator, but doesn't resolve the question of which future impl Trait should have. This is exactly the same problem that I aim to address with as impl Trait.\nfor blocks\n@glaebhoerl suggests using for blocks to desugar return-position impl Trait for generic free functions. It's a cool idea, but doesn't get much further exploration as the RFC period was winding down.\nExpanded impl Trait\nThis RFC, in essence, took on all the bikeshedding that wasn't ultimately essential to the first RFC. It does manage to introduce impl Trait in argument position, resolve bikeshedding around syntax, and come to a conclusion about type and lifetime parameters interacting with impl Trait.\nThere's honestly not too much to discuss here that hasn't already been discussed. Most of this RFC is consensus building and cornering impl Trait to prevent it from getting out of hand. This is a valuable RFC to read if you want to understand the specific semantics of impl Trait.\nimpl Trait existential types\nWe've finally caught up and are moving on to the more experimental RFCs. This RFC aims to introduce existential types and expand impl Trait to more places. I have some real critiques of this RFC, so let's get into them.\nas impl Trait in spirit\nOne of the first sections of this RFC suggests this syntax for abstracted types:\nlet displayable: impl Display = \"Hello, world!\";\n\nThis doesn't include the concrete underlying type, and so I think this would be much clearer as:\nlet displayable: &amp;'static str as impl Display = \"Hello, world!\";\n// or, with variable type inference\nlet displayable: _ as impl Display = \"Hello, world!\";\n\nThis addresses the same problems, but with an arguably clearer syntax:\n// Concrete\nconst DISPLAYABLE: &amp;'static str = \"Hello, world!\";\n// Abstract\nconst DISPLAYABLE: &amp;'static str as impl Display = \"Hello, world!\";\n\nAnd can handle unnameable types with local inference:\nconst MY_CLOSURE: _ as impl Fn(i32) -&gt; i32 = |x| x + 1;\n\nExistential types\nThis section in particular muddies the water with impl Trait. The introduction of existential types is intended to provide the same type-abstracting functionality as impl Trait, but with the added benefit of being usable in more positions. There is a particular focus on type aliases and associated types, where the concrete underlying type is inferred based on its use.\nI believe that inferring this concrete type is a mistake, and leads to the same inference issues discussed in the last post. Additionally, there is a large focus on not naming the concrete type to prevent trait impls from leaking. However I think this confuses the abstraction of a type with the naming of it. It's clearer to name a type and explicitly abstract it.\nFundamentally, I believe that existential types are a less clear formulation of as impl Trait. That's a very subjective opinion.\nType alias impl trait\nFinally, this RFC is nice and light. It simply builds on the existential types RFC by explicitly setting the syntax to use impl Trait. There is a lot of language lawyering and nailing down the very specific semantics, and it does a good job of explaining why additional syntax hinders learnability and results in confusion. We've already discussed the pros and cons of this RFC extensively, and I think we can do better.\nConclusion\nimpl Trait has taken a long journey to reach where it is now. Along the way there has been great ambition, as well as great confusion. I understand that there are very strong convictions on both sides, and I hope that we can use this as an opportunity to finally resolve them.\nIn my final post, I hope to bring the past three posts together into a coherent framework and provide a final recommendation on what should be done with impl Trait. If you've made it this far, I appreciate it a lot and hope you can hang on for just a little while longer.\n","id":"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/a-new-impl-trait-3/","title":"A new impl Trait 3/4"},"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/a-new-impl-trait-4/":{"body":"The end\nThis post is the culmination of the previous three posts, which discussed the nature of impl Trait, how to improve it, and prior work on impl Trait. This is my final recommendation on a path forward for impl Trait.\nRecap\nAs a quick recap, I suggest introducing a new as impl Trait language feature that abstracts types in general. Augmented with either named unnameable types or expanded type inference, this change would enable all existing functionality while making code clearer and more orthogonal.\nStepping stones\nWe've been breezing through many different examples and suggestions without really consolidating our knowledge. Let's take some time to build up some higher-level facts that we can use to inform our final analysis.\nThe lesser of two evils\nIn this case, the two evils are type inference and named unnameable types. In order for as impl Trait to function, we must choose one of these. Note that we have already chosen one of these (type inference) with impl Trait. I personally think that return type inference is simpler but less in line with Rust's goals1. Let's consult a motivating example:\nfn foo&lt;T&gt;(value: T) -&gt; ?? {\n    move || value\n}\n\nfn bar() -&gt; ?? {\n    foo(42)\n}\n\nI would like to have some function foo return a closure that yields some given value. Then, I would like to have some function bar call foo with a predefined value and return the same type. foo's return type must either be inferred or named.\nInferred\nIf foo's return type is inferred, then bar must either:\n\nInfer it from its body (i.e. fn bar() -&gt; _ { foo(42) }, this is basically what impl Trait does right now)\nOr, refer to foo to name its return type (i.e. fn bar() -&gt; &lt;foo as Fn&lt;(T,)&gt;&gt;::Output)\n\nA type alias doesn't change the situation here, as it would also either state type Output = &lt;foo as Fn(T)&gt;::Output or type Output = _.\nIf we infer the return type of bar from its body, we end up long-range type inference and spooky action at a distance. This has the additional downside that it opens the door for inference to be used in places where it's not strictly necessary. This could lead to further confusion and, in my opinion, would render the feature more harm than good.\nIf we refer to foo to name bar's return type, we end up with foo only performing local inference which is arguably better. However, we suffer from the explicit function output signature, especially when we want to change the definition of foo. Modifying its arguments would require modifying the type signature of bar (or equivalently, the signature of the type alias) even when the return type has not changed. It makes maintenance more difficult at the same time as making discoverability more difficult.\nNamed\nIf we can name foo's return type, then bar can reuse that:\nfn a&lt;T&gt;(value: T) -&gt; type 'Closure&lt;T&gt; {\n    'Closure&lt;T&gt;: move || value\n}\n\nfn b() -&gt; type 'Closure&lt;i32&gt; {\n    a(42)\n}\n\nThis opens up new possibilities with closures, and extends nicely to async blocks which are the other main unnameable type. It also alleviates a major problem with naming these types, which was previously done by creating a type alias and using inference to achieve the same result.\nThe obvious downside is that this breaks encapsulation. There are also some very thorny questions regarding generics for closures that depend on type arguments. As a result, I recommend making this change a separate issue for as impl Trait. In the meantime, we could allow the old-style impl Trait wherever we would write _ as impl Trait or type 'Closure as impl Trait.\nFiner details\nWith a new syntax as impl Trait to perform type abstraction, we must decide:\nAre all i32 as impl Debug the same type?\nAs an example:\nfn a() -&gt; i32 as impl Debug {\n    42\n}\n\nfn b() -&gt; i32 as impl Debug {\n    10\n}\n\nCould we do let mut x = a() and then x = b()? These run contrary to the idea that as impl Trait creates a new type that only exposes a minimum of traits and information, so the answer here must be no. This leads naturally to the idea of as impl Debug as the desugaring site for abstraction itself:\nstruct A&lt;T: Debug&gt;(T);\nfn a() -&gt; A&lt;i32&gt; {\n    A(42)\n}\n\nstruct B&lt;T: Debug&gt;(T);\nfn b() -&gt; B&lt;i32&gt; {\n    B(10)\n}\n\nNow it is evident that a and b do not return types that can be meaningfully compared or exchanged. To unify them:\ntype Output = i32 as impl Debug;\n\nfn a() -&gt; Output {\n    42\n}\n\nfn b() -&gt; Output {\n    10\n}\n\nWould then desugar to:\nstruct Output&lt;T: Debug&gt;(T);\n\nfn a() -&gt; Output&lt;i32&gt; {\n    Output(42)\n}\n\nfn b() -&gt; Output&lt;i32&gt; {\n    Output(10)\n}\n\nIn which case we can see that the return values of a and b can support those operations.\nUnnamed in return position\nIt's worth noting that this still suffers from the same composability restrictions that impl Trait does in return position:\n// crate `a`\nfn a() -&gt; i32 as impl Debug { 42 }\n\n// crate `b`\nfn b() -&gt; ?? { a() }\n\nBecause b must return the same type as a, it needs some way to return to a's return type. The most commonly suggested way to do this is to use Fn traits:\nfn b() -&gt; &lt;a as Fn&lt;()&gt;&gt;::Output { a() }\n\nWhich works, but suffers from the verbosity of the syntax. This is a problem already discussed with type inference.\nIn practice\nNow that we have the groundwork laid, we can make some engineering decisions:\nThe ultimate goal\nI believe that return position impl Trait should be deprecated in favor of as impl Trait. Additionally, we must either stabilize naming the return value of a function (e.g. &lt;foo as Fn()&gt;::Output) or ban as impl Trait in return position. In the latter case, it would still be legal in type alises and that would effectively relegate it to syntax sugar for creating abstracted types. That's not necessarily a bad thing; remember that the ? operator was a huge quality of life improvement and yet is relatively simple syntax sugar.\nThe major fork in the road is that we must choose between type inference and explicit naming for unnameable types. They both have their pros and cons, and inference could be restricted to a local context if used with named function return values. I believe that any longer-range type inference (e.g. TAIT) is likely to cause more problems than it solves. Explicitly naming unnameable types requires some exotic syntax and may also cause more problems than it solves.\nI think it would be acceptable to keep impl Trait in argument position since its sugar is sufficiently simple and its purpose is orthogonal to other features. However, I would be in support of removing it entirely to keep the language consistent and clean if others preferred that.\nThe way there\nOn our way there, we can lint and suggest replacing impl Trait with a concrete T as impl Trait:\ntype Output = impl Debug;\n//            ^^^^^^^^^^\n// WARNING: Output is nameable type `i32` and should be declared as:\n//   type Output = i32 as impl Debug;\n\nThis would help push users to use the more explicit as impl Trait syntax and help prevent errors down the line from confusing inference situations. Similarly, we should ban or lint on impl Trait used on nameable types in return position:\nfn target() -&gt; impl Debug {\n//             ^^^^^^^^^^\n// WARNING: return type is nameable type `i32` and should be declared as:\n//          fn target() -&gt; i32 as impl Debug\n    42\n}\n\nHowever we must acknowledge that there are still situations where we must allow closures and async blocks to take advantage of inference.\nfn target() -&gt; impl Clone {\n    || 42\n}\n\nAnd if we want to allow local inference, perhaps a lint would be best in this case as well:\nfn target() -&gt; impl Clone {\n//             ^^^^^^^^^^\n// WARNING: impl Trait is deprecated\n// NOTE:    use explicit inference instead: `_ as impl Clone`\n    || 42\n}\n\nI see this as very similar to the change from Trait to dyn Trait, so many of the same strategies are likely to work here as well.\nThe largest obstacle for as impl Trait will be building consensus for either type inference or named unnameables. Because this space is still up in the air, I think a discussion of as impl Trait would be good to keep separate. When we do come to a consensus on how to resolve this issue, we can deprecate impl Trait completely. That would allow us to complete the transition and resolve many longstanding issues related to impl Trait.\nConclusion\nWhew, that was a lot of work. Hopefully I've inspired some new ideas and thoughts about impl Trait. Let's have some lively debate about it and see if we can make Rust a better language for everyone.\nThanks\nThanks to @computerdruid and @tmandry in particular for reviewing this series of posts and helping me hone my understanding of impl Trait.\n1 Don't get me wrong, I actually like type inference and use it all the time. However, I think of Rust's typing philosophy as a kind of \"stabilized inference\" model.\nIn geotechnical engineering, it's common practice to use regular soil for building retaining walls, seawalls, and dikes. However, soil alone is not very strong and can easily flow when exposed to movement or water. A seawall made of plain soil would very quickly collapse from the soil shifting and flowing, but we can fix that by adding \"reinforcement\" to it. These are layers within the soil that provide stiffness and friction to prevent the soil from moving. It's kind of like a dirt sandwich with many layers, and it's surprisingly effective.\nI think of Rust's type inference like the soil: it's on-site, abundant, and a natural choice for construction. But it has a tendency to shift and flow because it's only loosely held together. In large quantities it can quickly shift and flow when exposed to change. Likewise, I think of function signatures as the reinforcement. It's not a lot of material, but it's stiff and prevents the type inference inside of function bodies from moving too much. Just this little bit of added stiffness prevents changes from propagating across function boundaries, keeping the system as a whole stable.\nThis is why I like type inference in statements, but I'm not a fan of type inference in function signatures.","id":"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/a-new-impl-trait-4/","title":"A new impl Trait 4/4"},"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/anima-playground/":{"body":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControls\n\nMove: WASD/Arrow keys (desktop), swipe (mobile)\nUndo: Space (desktop), top left button\nReset: Shift + Space (desktop), bottom left button\nUnfocus: Escape (desktop), click away, tap (mobile)\n\n","id":"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/anima-playground/","title":"Anima Playground"},"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/anima-puzzles/":{"body":"Controls\n\nMove: WASD/Arrow keys (desktop), swipe (mobile)\nUndo: Space (desktop), top left button\nReset: Shift + Space (desktop), bottom left button\nUnfocus: Escape (desktop), click away, tap (mobile)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","id":"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/anima-puzzles/","title":"Anima Puzzles"},"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/intelligent-brute-forcing/":{"body":"A little background\nBack in college, I played a lot of puzzle games. When I talk about these kinds of games, I'm going\nto be referring to a very specific subset of puzzle game. Some examples include:\n\nStephen's Sausage Roll\nEnglish Country Tune\nSokobond\n\nI was also fortunate to take Data Structures at RPI, where at the time professor Cutler (hi Barb!)\nhad a yearly assignment/competition where students to write a puzzle solver. The game changed\nevery year, and for my year the game was\nRicochet Robots,\nwhich is essentially a sliding ice puzzle with multiple players. I really enjoyed the assignment\n(and won the competition!) and continued to enter the competition as a TA. I probably went too hard\non it in retrospect; hopefully I wasn't too much of a nuisance!\nAnyway, the purpose of the assignment was to get everyone familiar with recursion and depth-first\nsearch. Your program would be given the initial state of the game as well as a maximum recursion\ndepth. The goal was to return either the shortest possible solution, or all possible solutions of\nminimum length. For the competition, you may or may not be passed a depth limit and might also be\ngiven puzzles that had no solution. I learned a lot and had a lot of fun, so maybe you will too.\nAbstract\nIn this article, I will present a new puzzle game and demonstrate techniques I used to write a fast,\npractical solver for it. Topics covered will include breadth-first/A* search, memoization,\noptimization, and strategies specific to NP-hard and NP-complete puzzle games. If you spot any\nproblems or want to suggest any improvements, please file an issue or submit a PR\non GitHub. I will present benchmarks to validate my\nresults throughout. While the percentage changes should be relatively accurate, the absolute timings\nmay vary throughout as they are taken at different times with different amounts of baseline noise.\nThe pre-/post- change benchmarks are always run back-to-back to ensure that they are run in the same\nenvironment and provide accurate percentage change.\nLet's play a game\nThe game we're going to play is called \"Anima\". It uses a grid of tiles, each of which is either\npassable or impassable. Some tiles are marked with a small colored diamond; these tiles are goals\nand to solve the puzzle we have to cover all of these tiles simultaneously with actors of the same\ncolor. Actors are blocks, at most one per tile, that can be moved around the grid on the passable\ntiles. Each turn, you may move the actors in one of the four cardinal directions and they all slide\ntogether. Let's do a few to get a feel for it:\nControls\n\nMove: WASD/Arrow keys (desktop), swipe (mobile)\nUndo: Space (desktop), top left button\nReset: Shift + Space (desktop), bottom left button\nUnfocus: Escape (desktop), click away, tap (mobile)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese two are pretty easy, but you might have noticed some implicit rules that make solving these\npuzzles nontrivial:\n\nIf an actor tries to move into an impassable tile, they do not move.\nIf an actor would overlap another actor, they do not move.\n\nThese side-effects make it very difficult (impossible?) to predict how the system will behave after\neven a move or two, which is a hallmark of problems with high NP-complexity. We'll add one more\ntwist to make it a little more interesting:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike red actors, blue actors move in the opposite direction you choose. If you choose left, blue\nactors will move right and vice-versa. This leads to one final implicit rule:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen they're right next to each other, red and blue actors can pass through each other to exchange\npositions. However, if they're separated by a single space, they'll try to move onto the same space\nand block each other from moving at all. This added complexity can make puzzles much more difficult\nto solve.\nBefore diving in, I'd definitely recommend trying out some more puzzles to get a better feel for\nsome high-level techniques and to get better acquainted with the game. Don't worry about solving\nall of these, they can get very hard. Just work with them until you feel competent and confident.\nPractice Puzzles\n\nThis is where we start writing our solver. You can follow along using the start tag on the\nGitHub repo, which will start you with all of the\nboilerplate:\ngit clone --branch start https://github.com/djkoloski/anima_solver\n\nA basic solver\nOur strategy for a basic solver will be to explore, one move at a time, out from\nthe initial state until we find a solution.

State is the positions of the actors, and Data\nis the layout of the board and goal positions. These are separated out to minimize how much memory\nis being used by queue.\nThe transitions() method operates on a State, takes some Data, and returns the new states\nwe reach by performing every possible move. An Indeterminate transition means that the state you\nreach is not solved, and a Success transition means that it is.\n\nparents here is a list of (usize, Direction) that tracks what state it came from and what\ndirection was moved to transition. When we get a successful transition, we crawl back through the\nparents vector to reassemble the solution and return it. Let's try it out!\nWe're going to use a nice and simple one to test:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$ cargo run -- puzzles/line_dance.txt\npuzzles/line_dance.txt:\nParse: 0.000201900s\nSolve: 0.000017600s\nFound solution of length 2:\nRight, Right\n\nCool, it found it! And that looks right too, let's see how fast it is in release mode:\n$ cargo run --release -- puzzles/line_dance.txt\npuzzles/line_dance.txt:\nParse: 0.000122700s\nSolve: 0.000009100s\nFound solution of length 2:\nRight, Right\n\nRoughly twice as fast, great! We're going to be running exclusively in release mode from here on\nout. Now let's step it up a little bit and try a harder puzzle:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$ cargo run --release -- puzzles/u_turn.txt\npuzzles/u_turn.txt:\nParse: 0.005942000s\nSolve: 0.001093200s\nFound solution of length 6:\nDown, Down, Left, Left, Up, Up\n\nAwesome, it got that one too! One more, this one's really more of the same:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$ cargo run --release -- puzzles/spiral.txt\n...\n\nUh oh, this one doesn't seem to be going anywhere fast. And if you don't kill it soon, you might run\nout of memory too! Looking at the timings explains why:\npuzzles/line_dance.txt\nSolve: 0.000009100s\nFound solution of length 2:\n\npuzzles/u_turn.txt\nSolve: 0.001093200s\nFound solution of length 6:\n\nBy adding just four moves to the solution length, our runtime went up by a factor of 120x! Let's\ntake a peek at how many states we're exploring:\nprintln!(\"Explored {} states\", parents.len());\n\n$ cargo run --release -- puzzles/line_dance.txt\nExplored 3 states\n\n$ cargo run --release -- puzzles/u_turn.txt\nExplored 5364 states\n\nYikes, there's our problem. And it makes sense, every state we explore leads to four more states so\nwe should expect that a solution of length n will explore at least (4^n - 1) / 3 states. For a\n6-move solution, that comes out to between 1365 and 5461 states, so we're right in that range. What\ndoes that mean for our currently-unsolvable puzzle? It takes 16 moves to solve it, so we should\nexpect to explore between 1431655765 and 5726623061 states.\nUh oh.\nNow it's time to start iterating on our solver and improving it. We will measure progress by\nmeasuring how long it takes to solve existing puzzles, then creating new and more difficult puzzles\nas we go along. Our goal will be to quickly solve all puzzles that we can create.\nState tracking\nFirst, we should observe that even though we explored 5364 states for U-Turn, there are\nfunctionally only seven unique states: one for each of the tiles the actor could be on. So we must\nbe exploring the same state multiple times. We can avoid this by storing our explored states in a\nhash set and only exploring its children if it's not already been visited:\nlet mut states = HashSet::new();\n...\n\nwhile let Some(parent_node) = queue.pop_front() {\n    index += 1;\n\n    if !states.contains(&amp;parent_node) {\n        ...\n\n        states.insert(parent_node);\n    }\n}\n\nLet's see how this affects our cases so far:\n$ cargo run --release -- puzzles/u_turn.txt\nExplored 20 states\nSolve: 0.000895100s\nFound solution of length 6:   \nDown, Down, Left, Left, Up, Up\n\nThat looks much better! Maybe we can solve our new puzzle now?\n$ cargo run --release -- puzzles/spiral.txt\nExplored 51 states\npuzzles/spiral.txt:\nParse: 0.000212300s\nSolve: 0.001049000s\nFound solution of length 16:\nLeft, Left, Up, Up, Right, Right, Right, Right, Down, Down, Down, Down, Left, Left, Left, Left\n\nThat's much better, bringing our explored states down from over a billion to just 51. This\noptimization alone brings all our sample puzzles into the realm of solvability! Now we can start\nbenchmarking our solver more comprehensively. Let's pick a few representatives from the\nsample puzzles set to bench:\n$ cargo bench\nsolve_square_dance      time:   [16.658 ms 16.888 ms 17.125 ms]\nsolve_fractal           time:   [44.606 ms 45.193 ms 45.806 ms]\nsolve_antiparticle      time:   [1.8001 s 1.8308 s 1.8640 s]\n\nEntropy reduction\nOne easy optimization we can make is to reduce the entropy of our states. Right now our puzzle state\nlooks like this:\nenum Color {\n    Red,\n    Blue,\n}\n\npub struct Actor {\n    position: Vec2,\n    color: Color,\n}\n\npub struct State {\n    actors: Vec&lt;Actor&gt;,\n}\n\nSo imagine a board with a few red actors on it. Let's say four, labeled A, B, C, and D:\n\nA_B\n___\nC_D\n\n\nWith these four actors, there's actually 4! ways we could represent the state since there are 4!\npermutations of the actors in the vector. We can fix this by sorting our actors array. This will\nreorder any permutation of the actors into one canonical ordering. We can do this pretty easily when\nwe transition our states:\npub fn transition(&amp;self, data: &amp;Data, direction: &amp;Direction) -&gt; State {\n    let mut result = self.clone();\n\n    ...\n\n    result.actors.sort();\n    result\n}\n\nA good way to think of this is as removing any unnecessary entropy in the state. Let's see how that\naffects our benchmarks:\n$ cargo bench\n\nsolve_square_dance      time:   [4.4875 ms 4.5667 ms 4.6525 ms]\n                        change: [-73.527% -72.960% -72.308%] (p = 0.00 &lt; 0.05)\n\nsolve_fractal           time:   [19.518 ms 19.647 ms 19.776 ms]\n                        change: [-57.178% -56.527% -55.885%] (p = 0.00 &lt; 0.05)\n\nsolve_antiparticle      time:   [187.49 ms 190.53 ms 193.91 ms]\n                        change: [-89.835% -89.593% -89.343%] (p = 0.00 &lt; 0.05)\n\nLet's see how the number of states explored (and branching factor) changed with that:\nPuzzleSolution LengthBefore (BF)After (BF)Change\nSquare Dance1237268 (2.292)11401 (2.061)-61.408%\nFractal1386277 (2.294)46253 (2.179)-46.390%\nAntiparticle222514936 (1.888)315100 (1.708)-87.471%\n\nGetting big performance improvements from small changes like this is what we're aiming to do most of\nthe time. The important thing here is that by reducing our state entropy, we reduced our branching\nfactor by a little bit. That small change amplifies quickly in exponential algorithms, so even a\nvery small decrease can lead to huge improvements.\nA* search\nWith that in mind, one easy way we can decrease our branching factor even more is by using a more\nsophisticated searching algorithm. A* is a very common augmentation to breadth-first search that\nprioritizes exploring more promising nodes first. In practice, this means that we have to define a\nheuristic function that estimates the minimum number of moves to completion. We want our heuristic\nfunction to estimate the remaining distance as closely as possible, but never overestimate. It's\nokay to underestimate. With this estimate of the number of moves remaining, we prioritize exploring\nstates that have the minimum estimated solution size (moves so far + remaining moves). This can help\nus avoid exploring states that are clearly dead ends and prioritize states that look promising.\nThe main difficulty with implementing A* is determining a good heuristic function. A good heuristic\nfunction should be easy to compute and return an estimate that is as high as possible without\noverestimating. This is a tradeoff that we actively have to be conscious of. In most cases, it will\nbe a net positive. Let's think about what heuristics we can calculate for our puzzle:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to complete the puzzle, each goal needs one actor of its color on top of it. Since all the\nactors move at the same time, we can use a straightforward maxmin: Find the nearest actor to each\ngoal and calculate the distance between them, then take the maximum value of all goal distances. The\nlogical way to think about this is that we're calculating the minimum number of moves necessary to\nget any actor of our choice to any given goal. This is an extremely rough estimate, but it will work\nfor us. If we wanted, we could calculate the\nassignment bottleneck instead,\nbut that could take a lot of time and negatively impact our performance. Also UPS lost my book from\nSIAM.\npub fn heuristic(&amp;self, data: &amp;Data) -&gt; usize {\n    let mut max_distance = 0;\n\n    for goal in data.goals.iter() {\n        let mut min_distance = usize::MAX;\n        for actor in self.actors.iter().filter(|a| a.color == goal.color) {\n            let d = (goal.position - actor.position).abs();\n            min_distance = usize::min(min_distance, (d.x + d.y) as usize);\n        }\n        max_distance = usize::max(max_distance, min_distance);\n    }\n\n    max_distance\n}\n\nDoes what it says on the tin. The more difficult part is adapting our existing solve function to\nprioritize states and calculate the heuristic. The first change we'll make is to bundle all of the\ninformation we need when exploring a node into a new structure:\n#[derive(Eq, PartialEq)]\nstruct Node {\n    state: State,\n    distance: usize,\n    estimate: usize,\n    index: usize,\n}\n\nThis will be what we insert into our queue now. Speaking of which:\nlet mut queue = BinaryHeap::new();\n\nA BinaryHeap is a simple data structure that we can use as a priority queue. We can insert items\nand remove the maximum value in log(N) time. All we need to do is define an ordering on our nodes\nthat gives the most promising nodes (with lowest distance + heuristic) the highest priority:\nimpl PartialOrd for Node {\n    fn partial_cmp(&amp;self, other: &amp;Self) -&gt; Option&lt;Ordering&gt; {\n        Some(self.cmp(other))\n    }\n}\n\nimpl Ord for Node {\n    fn cmp(&amp;self, other: &amp;Self) -&gt; Ordering {\n        other.estimate.cmp(&amp;self.estimate)\n    }\n}\n\nA little opaque, but this just says that we want to sort in reverse estimate order. Finally, we\nneed to change our push operation to account for the new fields we need to fill out in Node:\nlet estimate = state.heuristic(data) + (parent_node.distance + 1);\nqueue.push(Node {\n    state: state,\n    distance: parent_node.distance + 1,\n    estimate,\n    index: parents.len(),\n});\n\nInstead of counting our states as we pop them off, we now need to keep track of which index our\ncurrent state is in the parents list. And with that, we're done! We have a fully-functional A*\nimplementation ready to make our solver go super fast!\n$ cargo bench\n\nsolve_square_dance      time:   [4.4051 ms 4.4276 ms 4.4524 ms]\n                        change: [+3.7025% +4.6095% +5.4779%] (p = 0.00 &lt; 0.05)\n\nsolve_fractal           time:   [7.7314 ms 7.7718 ms 7.8183 ms]\n                        change: [-57.412% -57.044% -56.682%] (p = 0.00 &lt; 0.05)\n\nsolve_antiparticle      time:   [201.26 ms 202.26 ms 203.36 ms]\n                        change: [+14.570% +15.351% +16.121%] (p = 0.00 &lt; 0.05)\n\nWell that's a little disappointing. At least, it is if you only look at the individual benchmarks.\nTwo went up by around 5-15%, and one went down by over 50%. So while it wasn't a unilateral gain, it\ndid give us a net benefit overall. And now, if we can improve our heuristic function somehow we can\ngain the benefit from that too. Let's take a look at our explored states (and branching factor):\nPuzzleSolution LengthBefore (BF)After (BF)Change\nSquare Dance1211401 (2.061)9737 (2.031)-14.595%\nFractal1346253 (2.179)16593 (2.002)-64.126%\nAntiparticle22315100 (1.708)269211 (1.695)-14.563%\n\nIt's important to remember to benchmark very carefully, since even though our states explored fell\nfor every puzzle, our total runtime did increase for two of them. Also a very small change in the\nbranching factor for Fractal resulted in a massive decrease in explored states. The average\nruntime has fallen quite nicely.\nReducing allocations\nThe first rule of high-performance optimization is to reduce your allocations. Let's take a look and\nsee if there are some places we can do that:\npub fn transitions(&amp;self, data: &amp;Data) -&gt; Vec&lt;(Direction, Transition&lt;Self&gt;)&gt; {\n    ...\n}\n\nOur transitions function is returning a Vec with data allocated on the heap, but we know that\nwe'll always return four transitions. We can make this return an array instead:\npub fn transitions(&amp;self, data: &amp;Data) -&gt; [(Direction, Transition&lt;Self&gt;); 4] {\n    ...\n}\n\nLet's see what that gets us:\n$ cargo bench\n\nsolve_square_dance      time:   [4.4052 ms 4.4415 ms 4.4867 ms]\n                        change: [-7.0971% -6.1140% -4.9385%] (p = 0.00 &lt; 0.05)\n\nsolve_fractal           time:   [7.6836 ms 7.7682 ms 7.8720 ms]\n                        change: [-8.5312% -7.0938% -5.5943%] (p = 0.00 &lt; 0.05)\n\nsolve_antiparticle      time:   [207.00 ms 207.71 ms 208.44 ms]\n                        change: [-4.9600% -4.2495% -3.5907%] (p = 0.00 &lt; 0.05)\n\nSome modest gains, let's keep going. Next we can use the arrayvec crate to reduce the number of\nallocations in our states. It's essentially an inline-allocated array structure, so we won't\nconstantly be allocating heap memory as long as we can put an upper bound on the number of actors in\nour puzzles. Let's pick eight for some headroom:\npub struct State {\n    actors: ArrayVec&lt;Actor, 8&gt;,\n}\n\nHow about that:\n$ cargo bench\n\nsolve_square_dance      time:   [4.0299 ms 4.0567 ms 4.0854 ms]\n                        change: [-9.7690% -8.6635% -7.6778%] (p = 0.00 &lt; 0.05)\n\nsolve_fractal           time:   [7.4610 ms 7.5152 ms 7.5743 ms]\n                        change: [-4.6656% -3.2571% -1.9086%] (p = 0.00 &lt; 0.05)\n\nsolve_antiparticle      time:   [187.27 ms 188.29 ms 189.38 ms]\n                        change: [-9.9536% -9.3494% -8.7499%] (p = 0.00 &lt; 0.05)\n\nNice! Some more modest gains, but every bit helps. It's finally time to move on to...\nProfiling\nWe're out of low-hanging fruit, so let's move on to doing some micro-optimization. There's still\nplenty to be gained here though, and we can find it by doing some profiling. Running our benchmarks\nin Visual Studio gets us some interesting insights:\n\n\nHere they are typed out:\nFunctionTotal CPU %\nanima_solver::puzzle::State::transitions24.40%\nhashbrown::map::HashMap::contains_key20.72%\nhashbrown::map::HashMap::insert19.83%\nalloc::collections::binary_heap::BinaryHeap::pop15.91%\n\nOne thing that immediately jumps out is that we're spending almost the same amount of time in\nHashMap::contains_key as we do in HashMap::insert. But we don't have any hash maps in our\nsolver, do we?\nWell actually, we do. We're using a HashSet for our visited states, and that's secretly a\nHashMap&lt;K, ()&gt; under the hood. Let's take a look at our code:\nlet mut states = HashSet::new();\n\n...\n\nwhile let Some(parent_node) = queue.pop() {\n    if !states.contains(&amp;parent_node.state) {\n        for (action, transition) in parent_node.state.transitions(data) {\n            ...\n        }\n        states.insert(parent_node.state);\n    }\n}\n\nSo there's the problem, we're checking to see if the set contains the state, then getting our\ntransitions, and after that we're inserting the state. We should be able to use an Entry API to\ncheck if the set contains the state and insert it with a single lookup right? Well... HashSet\ndoesn't have an entry API like HashMap does yet.\nWell, I guess we can use a HashMap with a value of () right?\nlet mut states = HashMap::new();\n\n...\n\nwhile let Some(parent_node) = queue.pop() {\n    if let Entry::Vacant(entry) = states.entry(parent_node.state) {\n        for (action, transition) in entry.key().transitions(data) {\n            ...\n        }\n        entry.insert(());\n    }\n}\n\nThat should do the trick. Let's see how that changed our runtime:\n$ cargo bench\n\nsolve_square_dance      time:   [3.8785 ms 3.9364 ms 3.9998 ms]\n                        change: [+0.9796% +2.8698% +4.8065%] (p = 0.00 &lt; 0.05)\n\nsolve_fractal           time:   [6.7915 ms 6.8446 ms 6.9022 ms]\n                        change: [-2.2994% -1.2597% -0.0914%] (p = 0.03 &lt; 0.05)\n\nsolve_antiparticle      time:   [172.04 ms 172.76 ms 173.54 ms]\n                        change: [-2.4655% -1.8303% -1.1884%] (p = 0.00 &lt; 0.05)\n\nWell that's disappointing, there's statistically no change in runtime. I guess the entry API must\nhave some overhead that's just as expensive as a lookup and insert. If anyone has ideas on why this\ndidn't change the overall runtime, I'd love to know. But this also shows the importance of\nbenchmarking every step of the way. Even the most obvious improvements can end up having no effect\non the overall performance, or worse a negative impact.\nContainer pre-sizing\nWe're getting close to the bottom of the barrel. A quick and easy optimization we can do is to\npre-size our containers. This helps us skip any work we might do to resize containers for work loads\nunder some minimum size. I've picked some relatively arbitrary pre-sizes here:\nlet mut states = HashMap::with_capacity(4 * 1024);\nlet mut parents = Vec::with_capacity(4 * 1024);\nlet mut queue = BinaryHeap::with_capacity(1024);\n\nWe should expect these to only impact any puzzles that don't use memory above the pre-sizing\nthreshold. Do we?\n$ cargo bench\n\nsolve_square_dance      time:   [3.7025 ms 3.7311 ms 3.7652 ms]\n                        change: [-9.7612% -8.3409% -6.9754%] (p = 0.00 &lt; 0.05)\n\nsolve_fractal           time:   [6.0512 ms 6.1010 ms 6.1584 ms]\n                        change: [-15.633% -14.231% -12.778%] (p = 0.00 &lt; 0.05)\n\nsolve_antiparticle      time:   [177.28 ms 178.40 ms 179.59 ms]\n                        change: [-0.7913% +0.0458% +0.8882%] (p = 0.92 &gt; 0.05)\n\nThat's exactly what we see. We do get some very nice deltas on our smaller puzzles, but our larger\npuzzle benchmark is completely unaffected. Still, it's bringing down our average case and that's\nimportant for us. Finally, we can move on to the last optimization strategy:\nInlining\nOne of the last tools in our performance toolbox is function inlining. The impact of function\ninlining varies widely, and we should always be careful to benchmark our code along the way. Let's\nsee if there are any good candidates for inlining. Ideally, a good function to inline should either\nbe small or medium-sized and used once or twice. We have a lot of basic little functions in our\nvector and direction primitives that we can inline, so those might help a little. Inlining our\nespecially hot transition function for our puzzle state should also help eliminate some overhead.\nLet's see how that impacts our performance:\n$ cargo bench\n\nsolve_square_dance      time:   [3.7629 ms 3.8005 ms 3.8413 ms]\n                        change: [-10.293% -8.6516% -6.9645%] (p = 0.00 &lt; 0.05)\n\nsolve_fractal           time:   [6.7174 ms 6.8059 ms 6.9033 ms]\n                        change: [-10.243% -8.5148% -6.7086%] (p = 0.00 &lt; 0.05)\n\nsolve_antiparticle      time:   [175.97 ms 176.63 ms 177.38 ms]\n                        change: [-6.8481% -5.9110% -5.0767%] (p = 0.00 &lt; 0.05)\n\nA final solid set of improvements! It's always nice to see. Let's wrap up with some final thoughts.\nWrap up\nWe've successfully made a puzzle solver that's capable of solving all of our given inputs and\noptimized it using techniques specific to brute-forcing as well as general optimization techniques.\nWe looked at the performance impacts of various techniques and know what to expect in the future.\nFinally, we also learned not to assume that any particular optimization will affect every case\nevenly, or even positively.\nIn the future, the best gains will likely come from improving our heuristic function. For this\nrelatively simple game, there might not be much of a better heuristic we can calculate. In a more\ncomplex game, we can often leverage the information in the puzzle to make a much better function\nthough. When writing a solver for Stephen's Sausage Roll, which permitted a more accurate heuristic,\nthe gains from a heuristic function were much larger.\nFinally, you can actually use the solver written here right now! You can turn on the solver for any\npage that has a puzzle on it by adding &amp;controls=true to the URL\n(here for example). Here's one with the solver enabled, try\nit out! You can also write, import, and share your own puzzles.\nThanks for reading, and happy solving!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","id":"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/intelligent-brute-forcing/","title":"Intelligent brute forcing"},"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/rkyv-architecture/":{"body":"What is rkyv?\nrkyv is a zero-copy deserialization framework written in rust. It's deeply integrated into the language and has a lot of neat features with the new v0.2.0 release.\nI originally released and posted about rkyv in the rust subreddit and got a lot of great feedback. Along with a couple highly desired features, many people asked for a blog post about the design and internals of rkyv. This blog post should serve as a jumping-off point to understand rkyv and zero-copy deserialization in general.\nZero-copy deserialization\nZero-copy deserialization is a technique used to reduce memory consumption and eliminate work when reading from disk or another external source. This isn't really a precise term, since serde has support for zero-copy deserialization, but a very different kind than rkyv. Zero-copy deserialization is more of an umbrella term for techniques that use some of the data from the source and therefore don't copy it when deserializing, hence the name.\nTo be more precise, rkyv implements total zero-copy deserialization. All of the output of deserialization is borrowed from the input and no work is required to transform it from the external (on-disk) representation to the in-memory one. In practice, this means that you can do things like mmap files into memory and use them without deserialization. This is a technique that is sometimes used in the game industry, where performance requirements are very strict. Total zero-copy deserialization can drastically reduce load times which translates directly into a better user experience.\nrkyv architecture\nThis is where we can start getting into the meat and potatoes of rkyv. The first thing to understand about rkyv is relative pointers.\nRelative pointers\nThe first hurdle for total zero-copy deserialization is that regular pointers are not serializable. A pointer is just some address in memory, and that means that it might not even be a valid location for your program on a subsequent run. Even if we could get all of our data back into memory, we would still have to fix up the pointers so they point to the right locations.\nRelative pointers are a technique where instead of writing an absolute pointer to disk (which wouldn't come back pointing to the right place), we instead write an offset to some memory. That offset essentially points to \"the address of this plus some bytes\". A simple example of a relative pointer to a string is these bytes:\n0x0000    04 00 00 00 68 65 6c 6c\n0x0008    6f 20 77 6f 72 6c 64 21\n...\n\nWe'll assume that our relative pointers use 32-bit offsets. The first four bytes of the archive are the relative pointer, which encodes the offset to the string. The first four bytes are 04 00 00 00, which is four on little endian machines. This means that the data is located four bytes forward from the address of the offset. Since the offset is located at 0x0000, we should look for the data at 0x0000 + 4 = 0x0004!\nTaking a peek at that location reveals some bytes that look like ASCII, but we don't know how many yet! Along with the data for the bytes of a string, we also need to encode the length of the string. Let's update our example:\n0x0000    08 00 00 00 0c 00 00 00\n0x0008    68 65 6c 6c 6f 20 77 6f\n0x0010    72 6c 64 21 cd cd cd cd\n...\n\nNow there's two four-byte values: first the relative pointer and second the string length. The relative pointer now has bytes 08 00 00 00, four more than before since we now need to skip over the string length bytes. So the data is now located at 0x0000 + 8 = 0x0008. The length bytes tell us there should be 12 bytes at that location. Reading off the first 12 bytes from there gives us \"hello world!\"! Success!\nIn order to map those bytes into a structure in memory, we might put our ArchivedString together like this:\npub struct ArchivedString {\n    ptr: i32,\n    len: u32,\n}\n\nimpl ArchivedString {\n    pub fn as_bytes(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;[u8] {\n        unsafe {\n            let ptr = (self as *const Self)\n                .cast::&lt;u8&gt;()\n                .add(self.ptr);\n            slice::from_raw_parts(ptr, self.len as usize)\n        }\n    }\n\n    pub fn as_str(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;str {\n        unsafe {\n            str::from_utf8_unchecked(self.as_bytes())\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThe reality is just a little bit more complicated than this, but this is pretty close to the same code you can find in rkyv right now. The general idea behind rkyv is to take build these structures for all of our types so that we can serialize them out and get them back later without having to deserialize.\nArchiving dependencies\nThe next problem we have to tackle is actually creating those relative pointers. In order to make one, we need to know the locations of both the target memory and the relative pointer itself. This is a problem; how can we know where the relative pointer should point if we haven't written it yet?\nImagine that we had some struct that had two strings in it:\nstruct Pair {\n    key: String,\n    value: String,\n}\n\nIt's archived version would look like this:\nstruct ArchivedPair {\n    key: ArchivedString,\n    value: ArchivedString,\n}\n\nIn order to make our archived pair, we have to write the bytes of the key and value first, then construct the relative pointers for the strings. Let's brainstorm roughly what that would look like:\nimpl Pair {\n    fn archive(&amp;self, writer: &amp;mut Write) -&gt; ArchivedPair {\n        let key_pos = writer.write(self.key.as_bytes());\n        let value_pos = writer.write(self.value.as_bytes());\n\n        let base = writer.pos();\n\n        let key_off = offset_of!(ArchivedPair, key);\n        let value_off = offset_of!(ArchivedPair, value);\n        ArchivedPair {\n            key: ArchivedString::new(\n                base + key_off,\n                key_pos,\n                self.key.len()\n            ),\n            value: ArchivedString::new(\n                base + value_off,\n                value_pos,\n                self.value.len()\n            ),\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nRight off the bat, we've introduced some new concepts:\n\noffset_of! is a macro that tells us the offset of a field in our struct. We need to use this to make sure that we're using the positions of the strings within our struct instead of the position of the start of the struct.\nWrite is a writer like std::io::Write that we can write bytes to and which also knows the current position. We need this to get the base for our relative pointers.\n\nThis is a little simplified, but both of these are both concepts used extensively in rkyv. And this works! But what if we wanted to write an array of ArchivedPairs?\nWe've run into a problem!\nWe can write out the first pair just fine, but when write out the second pair we accidentally write our two strings where the second pair should be! Because they're in an array, the archived pairs have to be right next to each other. But there has to be a way around this, this is exactly like how we had to write out the key and value before building our pair!\nTaking a look at the archive function, you can see that the archive process is broken up into two steps:\n\nWrite out the bytes of your dependencies\nGet the current position and figure out your relative pointers using it\n\nThis translates to the two core traits in rkyv: Archive and Resolve. The first step is handled by Archive and the second is handled by Resolve. So what do these traits do?\nArchive and Resolve\nArchive writes out the dependencies of the type and returns a resolver. A resolver is a struct that contains the extra information we need to make an archived version of our type from the writer position and original value. A string's implementation might look like this:\nimpl Archive for String {\n    type Resolver = usize;\n\n    fn archive(&amp;self, writer: &amp;mut Writer) -&gt; Self::Resolver {\n        let pos = writer.pos();\n        writer.write(self.as_bytes());\n        pos\n    }\n}\n\nimpl Resolve for String {\n    type Archived = ArchivedString;\n\n    fn resolve(\n        &amp;self,\n        pos: usize,\n        resolver: usize\n    ) -&gt; Self::Archived {\n        ArchivedString {\n            ptr: RelPtr::from_to(pos, resolver),\n            len: self.len(),\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nIn the archive step, we write out the bytes for the string and return the position those bytes were written to. In the resolve step, we take that position and make a new relative pointer that points to them. Now if we wanted to archive an array of strings, we can archive them all and then resolve them all.\nOnce again, this is very simplified for the sake of example. But the real implementations of these are not too different!\nrkyv provides archived versions of core and standard library types for you out of the box, but you still need to provide them for your own types. That's why rkyv also provides a handy derive macro that does all the heavy lifting for you! Just add #[derive(Archive)] to your type and rkyv will generate an archived type, resolver, and implementations of Archive and Resolve automagically.\nExtending rkyv\nBeing able to archive types made out of library types is enough functionality for some, but there are a few holes in our system that we need to plug up.\nThe first trait is ArchiveRef, which is like Archive for unsized types. Instead of resolving to an archived version of themselves, they instead resolve to a something that dereferences to the archived type. A good way to think about this is that ArchiveRef is Archive for unsized types which use wide pointers with extra associated data.\nThis allows us to implement Archive for types like Box, which needs to be able to archive unsized types like slices and str's. We can also archive our own unsized types with things like trailing slices, even though they're pretty uncommon in practice.\nThe last hole we need to plug is trait objects. Unfortunately this one is pretty complicated, so if you're really interested in how trait object archiving works, I would recommend you look at some of the source for rkyv_dyn, the crate that adds trait object serialization to rkyv.\nConclusion\nEven though this overview is pretty basic, it gives a relatively complete overview of how rkyv works internally. The core ideas are pretty simple, the complicated part is really just writing the core and std implementations.\nIf you weren't interested in rkyv before and are now, try it out and see how you like it! I just shipped a shiny new version with some great new features including validation and mutable archives.

With that in mind, I can't disclaim enough that I am the creator and maintainer of rkyv. However, the last thing I want is to be biased, so I made some benchmarks to hopefully convince you on their own merits.\nBenchmarks\nThere are a couple different benchmarks already available, but in general they fail in a couple different ways:\nThey test with too little data\nThis leads to highly variable results and can make it difficult to see whether one library is really faster than another\nThey test only with simple data\nThe library may perform completely differently with complex and highly structured data\nThey test only serialization and deserialization\nFor most serialization formats, all you can do is serialize and deserialize data. But zero-copy deserialization libraries can access and traverse data without deserializing it first. Knowing how these operations compare with each other is essential to evaluating their relative performance.\nrust_serialization_benchmark\nWith these shortcomings in mind, I set off to make my own benchmarks. The goal was to be thorough and complete, and I think I did a pretty good job.\nYou can run the benchmarks yourself or look over the raw data from the github repo. I'll summarize the results.\nRules\nEach library got tested on three different data sets:\n\nlog: a data set of HTTP request logs that are small and contain many strings\nmesh: a single mesh composed of triangles, each of which has three vertices and a normal\nminecraft_savedata: a highly-structured data set modeled after Minecraft player savedata\n\nEach data set is randomly generated from an RNG seeded with the first 20 digits of pi, so the data tested is identical for every run. For each data set, a library was measured for the following:\n\nSerialize: how long it took to serialize the data\nDeserialize: how long it took to deserialize the data\nSize: how many bytes the serialized data occupied\nZlib: the serialized size after zlib compression\n\nAdditionally, zero-copy deserialization libraries were tested for:\n\nAccess: how long it took to get access to the serialized data\nRead: how long it took to run through the data and read fields\nUpdate: how long it took to update the serialized data\n\nThere are a couple footnotes that need explaining:\n\nAbomonation requires a mutable backing to access and read serialized data. This means that it's not viable for some use cases.\nAbomonation does not support buffer mutation, so this wasn't tested.\nWhile Flatbuffers and Cap'n Proto support buffer mutation in the main (usually C++) libraries, the rust counterparts do not and they couldn't be tested for this.\nNone of the other zero-copy deserialization frameworks provided deserialization capabilities by default. Writing and benchmarking my own deserialization code is somewhat meaningless for these. You can get an idea of what sort of deserialization performance you'd get by looking at the read benchmark.\nAbomonation's decode qualified as access not deserialize because it yields an immutable reference instead of a mutable object. In order to deserialize this object, a simple Clone would suffice but I'm not here to write and benchmark my own deserialization code.\n\nResults\nThese results are directly from the benchmark repo.\nlog\nThis data set is composed of HTTP request logs that are small and contain many strings.\nRaw data:\nFor operations, time per iteration; for size, bytes.

CBOR did a bit better than serde_json in every benchmark, but these two consistently trailed behind all the other frameworks (in some cases, very considerably behind).\nProst\nProst was the chosen representative for protobuf-style serialization. Its performance was average-to-lackluster on every benchmark, with the exception of the log size benchmark. It beat out postcard, which consistently performed extremely well in the size/zlib categories. This shows just how much the format was optimized for stringy data and minimizing wire size.\nbincode / postcard\nDespite being completely different libraries, bincode and postcard had very similar benchmark results. Serialize and deserialize speed were very close for both of them, and the main difference between the two was usually the final size. Postcard consistently beat bincode on size and zlib. I suspect that they are using very similar techniques, but that postcard has a few more tricks up its sleeve that don't cost much to perform but give it a sizeable advantage.\nCap'n Proto\nCap'n Proto had a good showing, and it proved its worth as a replacement for protobuf. Compared to prost, it was faster to serialize, and supported comparatively fast zero-copy deserialization. These two features are absolutely killer. Unfortunately, it didn't stack up nearly as well against the other zero-copy frameworks. It consistently had disapointing access and read times compared to its competitors, and failed pretty miserably on the mesh size benchmarks. This makes sense as it wasn't built to handle large amounts of raw data, but it was disappointing to see so much wasted space compared to FlatBuffers.\nFlatBuffers\nFlatBuffers is the comparison point for zero-copy deserialization. It's got a lot of usage, was built specifically for performance, and proves out the zero-copy concept. It did well in all categories on most of the tests, but had a major stumbling block. In the minecraft_savedata test, its serialization performance was by far the worst, even worse than serde_json (which had to write twice as much data!). This highlights a major weakness of FlatBuffers: its very poor serialization performance on highly-structured data. It's possible (even probable) that I wrote this bench more poorly than it could be, but it's enough that I wouldn't recommend its use for general-purpose data.\nAbomonation\nAbomonation was definitely a bright spot in the benchmarks. It proved out its insanely fast serialization on every bench, and didn't suffer from some of the size traps that its competitors fell into. It would be an easy library to recommend if it didn't come with so many caveats. It's very unsafe, non-portable, requires mutable backing to access its data, and doesn't support mutations. Nonetheless, abomonation was a really impressive contender in every benchmark.\nrkyv\nI went into these benchmarks not knowing how rkyv would perform relative to its peers, but confident that it would make a good showing. It ended up doing much better than I expected. It won nearly every performance category, and was highly competitive with the winner when it didn't. It also did so without compromising on size, where it was also highly competitive. Finally it showed exceptional scalability, peforming equally well on all different kinds of data where its zero-copy competitors all hard shortcomings on one or more of the data sets. Unlike abomonation, it's also a safe, highly-portable format that doesn't need mutable backing and has more feature support than other competitors.\nConclusion\nI welcome and encourage anyone to run the benchmarks for themselves and open pull requests to improve or clean up whatever they want. I am confident in the validity of these results, and will happily update the tables as changes are made. I will update my analyses if there are any major changes.\nMy hope is that this article not only convinced you that rkyv is one of the best-performing serializers available, but that it also helped you understand the relationships between the different serialization solutions available in rust today.\nIf you're interested in rkyv, I encourage you to contribute to the request for feedback for planning its future\nThanks to burntsushi for the article title inspiration\n","id":"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/rkyv-is-faster-than/","title":"rkyv is faster than {bincode, capnp, cbor, flatbuffers, postcard, prost, serde_json}"},"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/ssg-with-zola/":{"body":"I'm a big fan of Rust\nAnd so are a lot of other people.

Maybe it's because of what the language was built to do, or maybe it's a copy and paste of Mozilla internal culture, but either way it means that Rust makes really good tools. You might have heard of ripgrep, but you probably haven't heard of Zola.\nZola is a small static site generator that was originally called Gutenberg and is written in Rust. Its key features are:\n\nNo dependencies: it's just a single executable, perfect for embedding in repositories.\nBlazing fast: the average site generation time is well under a second.\nFully featured: has support for robust HTML templating with Tera Templates - another Rust project - and compiles Sass and Markdown for you.\n\nIf this piques your interest already, then I'd suggest you go grab the latest release and follow along.\nGetting started\nZola init\nMaking a new site project is incredibly easy - just run:\nzola init my_site\n\nand it will create a new directory named my_site with the right directory structure set up and ready to go. Just change into the new directory and keep going from there:\ncd my_site\n\nZola build\nBuilding the site is as simple as running:\nzola build\n\nand it will build the entire site into a new directory named public. This is how the final build of the site is made; copying the public directory to a simple file server is all you need to do to deploy.\nZola serve\nFor development, Zola comes with a development server built-in. Run:\nzola serve\n\nand it will continuously:\n\nWatch content, styles, and templates for changes\nRebuild the site on the fly\nRefresh the page through an injected script\n\nThis makes for a really great iteration loop since you don't have to constantly switch back and forth between your text editor and browser to refresh it. For obvious reasons, you shouldn't use use the Zola server to serve your final build.\nBuilding blocks\nPages and Sections\nZola is built on the idea that a site is compsed of pages and sections arranged in a tree structure.\nPages are leaf nodes on your site map, and they're meant to contain most or all of your content. Examples include blog posts and informational pages.\nSections are branch nodes on your site map, and they're meant to direct the user to the pages that they're interested in. Examples include directories that list out blog posts and link to them.\nThe content directory in a Zola project defines how the site is structured. Each directory defines a new section1 and the Markdown files inside of it are the pages that are children of that section2. This is why your root index page at my-site.com is a section: it contains all of the other sections and pages in the site.\nTemplates\nZola uses Tera Templates for page templating. They have a lot more documentation about the templating engine on their site, so I'll cover mainly how the Tera works with Zola.\nZola will look in the templates directory for HTML templates to apply to the Markdown files in the content directory. There are three main special templates:\n\nsection.html is applied to all sections.\npage.html is applied to all pages.\nindex.html is a special section template applied to the root section instead of section.html.\n\nZola will take all the metadata about sections and pages that it has available, and expose it through a section or page object to the template. The Markdown for the section or page can be injected into the template through either {{ section.content }} or {{ page.content }}.\nSass\nZola automatically compiles any Sass files directly under the sass directory into CSS files. Sass is a great set of extensions to CSS that make it easier to write and maintain your styles. I ended up mostly leveraging its variables, but there are a lot of other quality-of-life features and powerful styling tools that make it a joy to use.\nStatic content and Assets Colocation\nFiles placed in the static directory will be copied over as-is to the compiled site, so it's a good place to put content that will be used across the entire site.\nZola also supports \"assets colocation\", which is a fancy way of saying that if you put non-Markdown files under the content directory, they'll be copied over right next to other Markdown files' compiled HTML pages. This makes it really easy to organize pages that require custom assets like images and javascript files.\nConclusion\nAfter working with Zola for a while, the overall experience has been very pleasant. At first I found Zola's notion of sections and pages and little unintuitive, but I think that part of that is due to some confusing wording in their site's documentation. It was really easy to set up and the iteration loop is fast and efficient. While it's still a bit rough around the edges3, I can definitely recommend it for anyone looking to make a site like mine.\n1 For all sections except the top-level index, you also need to add an _index.md.\n2 With the exception of any _index.md files.\n3 I had problems with the built-in pagination functionality. It seems like it either doesn't work right or I don't understand it and the docs are too sparse. The server works pretty well for content serving, but every once in a while I managed to crash it with some syntax errors. The system that refreshes the browser page when the server rebuilds content also seems to mess up every once in a while, but restarting the server fixes it.\n","id":"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/ssg-with-zola/","title":"Static Site Generation with Zola"}},"docInfo":{"https://davidkoloski.me/":{"body":25,"title":2},"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/a-new-impl-trait-1/":{"body":1514,"title":4},"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/a-new-impl-trait-2/":{"body":1293,"title":4},"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/a-new-impl-trait-3/":{"body":924,"title":4},"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/a-new-impl-trait-4/":{"body":989,"title":4},"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/anima-playground/":{"body":27,"title":2},"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/anima-puzzles/":{"body":27,"title":2},"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/intelligent-brute-forcing/":{"body":2458,"title":3},"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/rkyv-architecture/":{"body":956,"title":3},"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/rkyv-is-faster-than/":{"body":1013,"title":9},"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/ssg-with-zola/":{"body":550,"title":4}},"length":12},"lang":"English"};
