When I talk about these kinds of games, I'm going\nto be referring to a very specific subset of puzzle game. Some examples include:\n\nStephen's Sausage Roll\nEnglish Country Tune\nSokobond\n\nI was also fortunate to take Data Structures at RPI, where at the time professor Cutler (hi Barb!)\nhad a yearly assignment/competition where students to write a puzzle solver. The game changed\nevery year, and for my year the game was\nRicochet Robots,\nwhich is essentially a sliding ice puzzle with multiple players. I really enjoyed the assignment\n(and won the competition!) and continued to enter the competition as a TA. I probably went too hard\non it in retrospect; hopefully I wasn't too much of a nuisance!\nAnyway, the purpose of the assignment was to get everyone familiar with recursion and depth-first\nsearch. Your program would be given the initial state of the game as well as a maximum recursion\ndepth. The goal was to return either the shortest possible solution, or all possible solutions of\nminimum length. For the competition, you may or may not be passed a depth limit and might also be\ngiven puzzles that had no solution. I learned a lot and had a lot of fun, so maybe you will too.\nAbstract\nIn this article, I will present a new puzzle game and demonstrate techniques I used to write a fast,\npractical solver for it. Topics covered will include Breadth-first/A* search, memoization,\noptimization, and strategies specific to NP-hard and NP-complete puzzle games. If you spot any\nproblems or want to suggest any improvements, please file an issue or submit a PR\non GitHub.\nLet's play a game\nThe game we're going to play is called \"Anima\". It uses a grid of tiles, each of which is either\npassable or impassable. Some tiles are marked with a small colored diamond; these tiles are goals\nand to solve the puzzle we have to cover all of these tiles simultaneously with actors of the same\ncolor. Actors are blocks, at most one per tile, that can be moved around the grid on the passable\ntiles. Each turn, you may move the actors in one of the four cardinal directions and they all slide\ntogether. Let's do a few to get a feel for it:\nControls\n\nMove: WASD/Arrow keys (desktop), swipe (mobile)\nUndo: Space (desktop), top left button\nReset: Shift + Space (desktop), bottom left button\nUnfocus: Escape (desktop), click away, tap (mobile)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese two are pretty easy, but you might have noticed some implicit rules that make solving these\npuzzles nontrivial:\n\nIf an actor tries to move into an impassable tile, they do not move.\nIf an actor would overlap another actor, they do not move.\n\nThese side-effects make it very difficult (impossible?) to predict how the system will behave after\neven a move or two, which is a hallmark of problems with high NP-complexity. We'll add one more\ntwist to make it a little more interesting:\n\nUnlike red actors, blue actors move in the opposite direction you choose. If you choose left, blue\nactors will move right and vice-versa. This leads to one final implicit rule:\n\nWhen they're right next to each other, red and blue actors can pass through each other to exchange\npositions. However, if they're separated by a single space, they'll try to move onto the same space\nand block each other from moving at all. This added complexity can make puzzles much more difficult\nto solve.\nBefore diving in, I'd definitely recommend trying out some more puzzles to get a better feel for\nsome high-level techniques and to get better acquainted with the game. Don't worry about solving\nall of these, they can get very hard. Just work with them until you feel competent and confident.\nPractice Puzzles\n\nThis is where we start writing our solver. You can follow along using the start tag on the\nGitHub repo, which will start you with all of the\nboilerplate:\ngit clone --branch start https://github.com/djkoloski/anima_solver\n\nA basic solver\nOur strategy for a basic solver will be to explore, one move at a time, out from\nthe initial state until we find a solution. I'll do this with a basic\nbreadth-first search augmented with parent tracking:\npub fn solve(initial_state: State, data: &amp;Data) -&gt; Option&lt;Vec&lt;Direction&gt;&gt; {\n    let mut parents = Vec::new();\n    let mut queue = VecDeque::new();\n\n    // Add transitions from initial state\n    for (action, transition) in initial_state.transitions(data) {\n        match transition {\n            Transition::Indeterminate(state) =&gt; {\n                parents.push((0, action));\n                queue.push_back(state);\n            }\n            Transition::Success =&gt; return Some(vec![action]),\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Pop states in order\n    let mut index = 0;\n    while let Some(parent_node) = queue.pop_front() {\n        index += 1;\n\n        for (action, transition) in parent_node.transitions(data) {\n            match transition {\n                Transition::Indeterminate(state) =&gt; {\n                    parents.push((index, action));\n                    queue.push_back(state);\n                }\n                Transition::Success =&gt; {\n                    let mut result_actions = vec![action];\n                    let mut current_index = index;\n                    while current_index != 0 {\n                        let (next_index, action) = parents.swap_remove(current_index - 1);\n                        result_actions.push(action);\n                        current_index = next_index;\n                    }\n                    result_actions.reverse();\n                    return Some(result_actions);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    None\n}\n\nThere's a lot of boilerplate omitted, so here's what's relevant:\n\nWe have State and Data structs where State is all the information that can change and\nData is all the information that is static. State is the positions of the actors, and Data\nis the layout of the board and goal positions. These are separated out to minimize how much memory\nis being used by queue.\nThe transitions() method operates on a State, takes some Data, and returns the new states\nwe reach by performing every possible move. An Indeterminate transition means that the state you\nreach is not solved, and a Success transition means that it is.\n\nparents here is a list of (usize, Direction) that tracks what state it came from and what\ndirection was moved to transition. When we get a successful transition, we crawl back through the\nparents vector to reassemble the solution and return it. Let's try it out!\nWe're going to use a nice and simple one to test:\n\n$ cargo run -- puzzles/line_dance.txt\npuzzles/line_dance.txt:\nParse: 0.000201900s\nSolve: 0.000017600s\nFound solution of length 2:\nRight, Right\n\nCool, it found it! And that looks right too, let's see how fast it is in release mode:\n$ cargo run --release -- puzzles/line_dance.txt\npuzzles/line_dance.txt:\nParse: 0.000122700s\nSolve: 0.000009100s\nFound solution of length 2:\nRight, Right\n\nRoughly twice as fast, great! We're going to be running exclusively in release mode from here on\nout. Now let's step it up a little bit and try a harder puzzle:\n\n$ cargo run --release -- puzzles/u_turn.txt\npuzzles/u_turn.txt:\nParse: 0.005942000s\nSolve: 0.001093200s\nFound solution of length 6:\nDown, Down, Left, Left, Up, Up\n\nAwesome, it got that one too! One more, this one's really more of the same:\n\n$ cargo run --release -- puzzles/spiral.txt\n...\n\nUh oh, this one doesn't seem to be going anywhere fast. And if you don't kill it soon, you might run\nout of memory too! Looking at the timings explains why:\npuzzles/line_dance.txt\nSolve: 0.000009100s\nFound solution of length 2:\n\npuzzles/u_turn.txt\nSolve: 0.001093200s\nFound solution of length 6:\n\nBy adding just four moves to the solution length, our runtime went up by a factor of 120x! Let's\ntake a peek at how many states we're exploring:\nprintln!(\"Explored {} states\", parents.len());\n\n$ cargo run --release -- puzzles/line_dance.txt\nExplored 3 states\n\n$ cargo run --release -- puzzles/u_turn.txt\nExplored 5364 states\n\nYikes, there's our problem. And it makes sense, every state we explore leads to four more states so\nwe should expect that a solution of length n will explore at least (4^n - 1) / 3 states. For a\n6-move solution, that comes out to between 1365 and 5461 states, so we're right in that range. What\ndoes that mean for our currently-unsolvable puzzle? It takes 16 moves to solve it, so we should\nexpect to explore between 1431655765 and 5726623061 states.\nUh oh.\nNow it's time to start iterating on our solver and improving it. We will measure progress by\nmeasuring how long it takes to solve existing puzzles, then creating new and more difficult puzzles\nas we go along. Our goal will be to quickly solve all puzzles that we can create.\nState tracking\nFirst, we should observe that even though we exploerd 5364 states for U-Turn, there are\nfunctionally only seven unique states: one for each of the tiles the actor could be on. So we must\nbe exploring the same state multiple times. We can avoid this by storing our explored states in a\nhash set and only exploring its children if it's not already been visited:\nlet mut states = Hashet::new();\n...\n\nwhile let Some(parent_node) = queue.pop_front() {\n    ...\n\n    if !states.contains(&amp;parent_node) {\n        ...\n\n        states.insert(parent_node);\n    }\n}\n\nLet's see how this affects our cases so far:\n$ cargo run --release -- puzzles/u_turn.txt\nExplored 20 states\nSolve: 0.000895100s\nFound solution of length 6:   \nDown, Down, Left, Left, Up, Up\n\nThat looks much better! Maybe we can solve our new puzzle now?\n$ cargo run --release -- puzzles/spiral.txt\nExplored 51 states\npuzzles/spiral.txt:\nParse: 0.000212300s\nSolve: 0.001049000s\nFound solution of length 16:\nLeft, Left, Up, Up, Right, Right, Right, Right, Down, Down, Down, Down, Left, Left, Left, Left\n\nThat's much better, bringing our explored states down from over a billion to just 51. This\noptimization alone brings all our sample puzzles into the realm of solvability! Now we can start\nbenchmarking our solver more comprehensively. Let's pick a few representatives from the\nsample puzzles set to bench:\n$ cargo bench\nsolve_square_dance      time:   [16.658 ms 16.888 ms 17.125 ms]\nsolve_fractal           time:   [44.606 ms 45.193 ms 45.806 ms]\nsolve_antiparticle      time:   [1.8001 s 1.8308 s 1.8640 s]\n\nEntropy reduction\nOne easy optimization we can make is to reduce the entropy of our states. Right now our puzzle state\nlooks like this:\nenum Color {\n    Red,\n    Blue,\n}\n\npub struct Actor {\n    position: Vec2,\n    color: Color,\n}\n\npub struct State {\n    actors: Vec&lt;Actor&gt;,\n}\n\nSo imagine a board with a few red actors on it. Let's say four:\nA.B\n...\nC.D\n\nWith these four actors, there's actually 4! ways we could represent the state since there are 4!\npermutations of the actors in the vector. We can fix this by sorting our actors array. This will\nreorder any permutation of the actors into one canonical ordering. We can do this pretty easily when\nwe transition our states:\npub fn transition(&amp;self, data: &amp;Data, direction: &amp;Direction) -&gt; State {\n    let mut result = self.clone();\n\n    ...\n\n    result.actors.sort();\n    result\n}\n\nA good way to think of this is as removing any unnecessary entropy in the state. Let's see how that\naffects our benchmarks:\n$ cargo bench\n\nsolve_square_dance      time:   [4.4875 ms 4.5667 ms 4.6525 ms]\n                        change: [-73.527% -72.960% -72.308%] (p = 0.00 &lt; 0.05)\n\nsolve_fractal           time:   [19.518 ms 19.647 ms 19.776 ms]\n                        change: [-57.178% -56.527% -55.885%] (p = 0.00 &lt; 0.05)\n\nsolve_antiparticle      time:   [187.49 ms 190.53 ms 193.91 ms]\n                        change: [-89.835% -89.593% -89.343%] (p = 0.00 &lt; 0.05)\n\nLet's see how the number of states explored (and branching factor) changed with that:\nPuzzleSolution LengthBefore (BF)After (BF)Change\nSquare Dance1237268 (2.292)11401 (2.061)-61.408%\nFractal1386277 (2.294)46253 (2.179)-46.390%\nAntiparticle222514936 (1.888)315100 (1.708)-87.471%\n\nGetting big performance improvements from small changes like this is what we're aiming to do most of\nthe time. The important thing here is that by reducing our state entropy, we reduced our branching\nfactor by a little bit. That small change amplifies quickly in exponential algorithms, so even a\nvery small decrease can lead to huge improvements.\nA* search\nWith that in mind, one easy way we can decrease our branching factor even more is by using a more\nsophisticated searching algorithm.\n$ cargo bench\n\nsolve_square_dance      time:   [4.4051 ms 4.4276 ms 4.4524 ms]\n                        change: [+3.7025% +4.6095% +5.4779%] (p = 0.00 &lt; 0.05)\n\nsolve_fractal           time:   [7.7314 ms 7.7718 ms 7.8183 ms]\n                        change: [-57.412% -57.044% -56.682%] (p = 0.00 &lt; 0.05)\n\nsolve_antiparticle      time:   [201.26 ms 202.26 ms 203.36 ms]\n                        change: [+14.570% +15.351% +16.121%] (p = 0.00 &lt; 0.05)\n\nPuzzleSolution LengthBefore (BF)After (BF)Change\nSquare Dance1211401 (2.061)9737 (2.031)-14.595%\nFractal1346253 (2.179)16593 (2.002)-64.126%\nAntiparticle22315100 (1.708)269211 (1.695)-14.563%\n\nTalk about: importance of benchmarking a variety of inputs, reducing maximum runtime vs average\nruntime\n","id":"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/intelligent-brute-forcing/","title":"Intelligent brute forcing"},"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/rkyv-architecture/":{"body":"What is rkyv?\nrkyv is a zero-copy deserialization framework written in rust. It's deeply integrated into the language and has a lot of neat features with the new v0.2.0 release.\nI originally released and posted about rkyv in the rust subreddit and got a lot of great feedback. Along with a couple highly desired features, many people asked for a blog post about the design and internals of rkyv. This blog post should serve as a jumping-off point to understand rkyv and zero-copy deserialization in general.\nZero-copy deserialization\nZero-copy deserialization is a technique used to reduce memory consumption and eliminate work when reading from disk or another external source. This isn't really a precise term, since serde has support for zero-copy deserialization, but a very different kind than rkyv. Zero-copy deserialization is more of an umbrella term for techniques that use some of the data from the source and therefore don't copy it when deserializing, hence the name.\nTo be more precise, rkyv implements total zero-copy deserialization. All of the output of deserialization is borrowed from the input and no work is required to transform it from the external (on-disk) representation to the in-memory one. In practice, this means that you can do things like mmap files into memory and use them without deserialization. This is a technique that is sometimes used in the game industry, where performance requirements are very strict. Total zero-copy deserialization can drastically reduce load times which translates directly into a better user experience.\nrkyv architecture\nThis is where we can start getting into the meat and potatoes of rkyv. The first thing to understand about rkyv is relative pointers.\nRelative pointers\nThe first hurdle for total zero-copy deserialization is that regular pointers are not serializable. A pointer is just some address in memory, and that means that it might not even be a valid location for your program on a subsequent run. Even if we could get all of our data back into memory, we would still have to fix up the pointers so they point to the right locations.\nRelative pointers are a technique where instead of writing an absolute pointer to disk (which wouldn't come back pointing to the right place), we instead write an offset to some memory. That offset essentially points to \"the address of this plus some bytes\". A simple example of a relative pointer to a string is these bytes:\n0x0000    04 00 00 00 68 65 6c 6c\n0x0008    6f 20 77 6f 72 6c 64 21\n...\n\nWe'll assume that our relative pointers use 32-bit offsets. The first four bytes of the archive are the relative pointer, which encodes the offset to the string. The first four bytes are 04 00 00 00, which is four on little endian machines. This means that the data is located four bytes forward from the address of the offset. Since the offset is located at 0x0000, we should look for the data at 0x0000 + 4 = 0x0004!\nTaking a peek at that location reveals some bytes that look like ASCII, but we don't know how many yet! Along with the data for the bytes of a string, we also need to encode the length of the string. Let's update our example:\n0x0000    08 00 00 00 0c 00 00 00\n0x0008    68 65 6c 6c 6f 20 77 6f\n0x0010    72 6c 64 21 cd cd cd cd\n...\n\nNow there's two four-byte values: first the relative pointer and second the string length. The relative pointer now has bytes 08 00 00 00, four more than before since we now need to skip over the string length bytes. So the data is now located at 0x0000 + 8 = 0x0008. The length bytes tell us there should be 12 bytes at that location. Reading off the first 12 bytes from there gives us \"hello world!\"! Success!\nIn order to map those bytes into a structure in memory, we might put our ArchivedString together like this:\npub struct ArchivedString {\n    ptr: i32,\n    len: u32,\n}\n\nimpl ArchivedString {\n    pub fn as_bytes(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;[u8] {\n        unsafe {\n            let ptr = (self as *const Self)\n                .cast::&lt;u8&gt;()\n                .add(self.ptr);\n            slice::from_raw_parts(ptr, self.len as usize)\n        }\n    }\n\n    pub fn as_str(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;str {\n        unsafe {\n            str::from_utf8_unchecked(self.as_bytes())\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThe reality is just a little bit more complicated than this, but this is pretty close to the same code you can find in rkyv right now. The general idea behind rkyv is to take build these structures for all of our types so that we can serialize them out and get them back later without having to deserialize.\nArchiving dependencies\nThe next problem we have to tackle is actually creating those relative pointers. In order to make one, we need to know the locations of both the target memory and the relative pointer itself. This is a problem; how can we know where the relative pointer should point if we haven't written it yet?\nImagine that we had some struct that had two strings in it:\nstruct Pair {\n    key: String,\n    value: String,\n}\n\nIt's archived version would look like this:\nstruct ArchivedPair {\n    key: ArchivedString,\n    value: ArchivedString,\n}\n\nIn order to make our archived pair, we have to write the bytes of the key and value first, then construct the relative pointers for the strings. Let's brainstorm roughly what that would look like:\nimpl Pair {\n    fn archive(&amp;self, writer: &amp;mut Write) -&gt; ArchivedPair {\n        let key_pos = writer.write(self.key.as_bytes());\n        let value_pos = writer.write(self.value.as_bytes());\n\n        let base = writer.pos();\n\n        let key_off = offset_of!(ArchivedPair, key);\n        let value_off = offset_of!(ArchivedPair, value);\n        ArchivedPair {\n            key: ArchivedString::new(\n                base + key_off,\n                key_pos,\n                self.key.len()\n            ),\n            value: ArchivedString::new(\n                base + value_off,\n                value_pos,\n                self.value.len()\n            ),\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nRight off the bat, we've introduced some new concepts:\n\noffset_of! is a macro that tells us the offset of a field in our struct. We need to use this to make sure that we're using the positions of the strings within our struct instead of the position of the start of the struct.\nWrite is a writer like std::io::Write that we can write bytes to and which also knows the current position. We need this to get the base for our relative pointers.\n\nThis is a little simplified, but both of these are both concepts used extensively in rkyv. And this works! But what if we wanted to write an array of ArchivedPairs?\nWe've run into a problem!\nWe can write out the first pair just fine, but when write out the second pair we accidentally write our two strings where the second pair should be! Because they're in an array, the archived pairs have to be right next to each other. But there has to be a way around this, this is exactly like how we had to write out the key and value before building our pair!\nTaking a look at the archive function, you can see that the archive process is broken up into two steps:\n\nWrite out the bytes of your dependencies\nGet the current position and figure out your relative pointers using it\n\nThis translates to the two core traits in rkyv: Archive and Resolve. The first step is handled by Archive and the second is handled by Resolve. So what do these traits do?\nArchive and Resolve\nArchive writes out the dependencies of the type and returns a resolver. A resolver is a struct that contains the extra information we need to make an archived version of our type from the writer position and original value. A string's implementation might look like this:\nimpl Archive for String {\n    type Resolver = usize;\n\n    fn archive(&amp;self, writer: &amp;mut Writer) -&gt; Self::Resolver {\n        let pos = writer.pos();\n        writer.write(self.as_bytes());\n        pos\n    }\n}\n\nimpl Resolve for String {\n    type Archived = ArchivedString;\n\n    fn resolve(\n        &amp;self,\n        pos: usize,\n        resolver: usize\n    ) -&gt; Self::Archived {\n        ArchivedString {\n            ptr: RelPtr::from_to(pos, resolver),\n            len: self.len(),\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nIn the archive step, we write out the bytes for the string and return the position those bytes were written to. In the resolve step, we take that position and make a new relative pointer that points to them. Now if we wanted to archive an array of strings, we can archive them all and then resolve them all.\nOnce again, this is very simplified for the sake of example. But the real implementations of these are not too different!\nrkyv provides archived versions of core and standard library types for you out of the box, but you still need to provide them for your own types. That's why rkyv also provides a handy derive macro that does all the heavy lifting for you! Just add #[derive(Archive)] to your type and rkyv will generate an archived type, resolver, and implementations of Archive and Resolve automagically.\nExtending rkyv\nBeing able to archive types made out of library types is enough functionality for some, but there are a few holes in our system that we need to plug up.\nThe first trait is ArchiveRef, which is like Archive for unsized types. Instead of resolving to an archived version of themselves, they instead resolve to a something that dereferences to the archived type. A good way to think about this is that ArchiveRef is Archive for unsized types which use wide pointers with extra associated data.\nThis allows us to implement Archive for types like Box, which needs to be able to archive unsized types like slices and str's. We can also archive our own unsized types with things like trailing slices, even though they're pretty uncommon in practice.\nThe last hole we need to plug is trait objects. Unfortunately this one is pretty complicated, so if you're really interested in how trait object archiving works, I would recommend you look at some of the source for rkyv_dyn, the crate that adds trait object serialization to rkyv.\nConclusion\nEven though this overview is pretty basic, it gives a relatively complete overview of how rkyv works internally. The core ideas are pretty simple, the complicated part is really just writing the core and std implementations.\nIf you weren't interested in rkyv before and are now, try it out and see how you like it! I just shipped a shiny new version with some great new features including validation and mutable archives. You can find the source on github for more information.\nThanks for reading!\n","id":"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/rkyv-architecture/","title":"rkyv architecture and internals"},"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/rkyv-is-faster-than/":{"body":"I've been working on rkyv, a zero-copy deserialization library, since November of 2020. rkyv is similar to Cap'n Proto and FlatBuffers, but has a handful of different design choices that make it stand out:\n\nNo type restrictions: you can serialize anything with rkyv\nNo external schemas: you can use the library with just #[derive]s\nRust-only: it doesn't sacrifice simplicity and performance for cross-language compatibility\nSafe mutation: the only rust library (I tested) that supports mutating data without deserializing\nScalable: works equally well for small and large payloads\n\nBut just having design goals isn't good enough, you need results to back them up. With that in mind, I can't disclaim enough that I am the creator and maintainer of rkyv. However, the last thing I want is to be biased, so I made some benchmarks to hopefully convince you on their own merits.\nBenchmarks\nThere are a couple different benchmarks already available, but in general they fail in a couple different ways:\nThey test with too little data\nThis leads to highly variable results and can make it difficult to see whether one library is really faster than another\nThey test only with simple data\nThe library may perform completely differently with complex and highly structured data\nThey test only serialization and deserialization\nFor most serialization formats, all you can do is serialize and deserialize data. But zero-copy deserialization libraries can access and traverse data without deserializing it first. Knowing how these operations compare with each other is essential to evaluating their relative performance.\nrust_serialization_benchmark\nWith these shortcomings in mind, I set off to make my own benchmarks. The goal was to be thorough and complete, and I think I did a pretty good job.\nYou can run the benchmarks yourself or look over the raw data from the github repo. I'll summarize the results.\nRules\nEach library got tested on three different data sets:\n\nlog: a data set of HTTP request logs that are small and contain many strings\nmesh: a single mesh composed of triangles, each of which has three vertices and a normal\nminecraft_savedata: a highly-structured data set modeled after Minecraft player savedata\n\nEach data set is randomly generated from an RNG seeded with the first 20 digits of pi, so the data tested is identical for every run. For each data set, a library was measured for the following:\n\nSerialize: how long it took to serialize the data\nDeserialize: how long it took to deserialize the data\nSize: how many bytes the serialized data occupied\nZlib: the serialized size after zlib compression\n\nAdditionally, zero-copy deserialization libraries were tested for:\n\nAccess: how long it took to get access to the serialized data\nRead: how long it took to run through the data and read fields\nUpdate: how long it took to update the serialized data\n\nThere are a couple footnotes that need explaining:\n\nAbomonation requires a mutable backing to access and read serialized data. This means that it's not viable for some use cases.\nAbomonation does not support buffer mutation, so this wasn't tested.\nWhile Flatbuffers and Cap'n Proto support buffer mutation in the main (usually C++) libraries, the rust counterparts do not and they couldn't be tested for this.\nNone of the other zero-copy deserialization frameworks provided deserialization capabilities by default. Writing and benchmarking my own deserialization code is somewhat meaningless for these. You can get an idea of what sort of deserialization performance you'd get by looking at the read benchmark.\nAbomonation's decode qualified as access not deserialize because it yields an immutable reference instead of a mutable object. In order to deserialize this object, a simple Clone would suffice but I'm not here to write and benchmark my own deserialization code.\n\nResults\nThese results are directly from the benchmark repo.\nlog\nThis data set is composed of HTTP request logs that are small and contain many strings.\nRaw data:\nFor operations, time per iteration; for size, bytes.

CBOR did a bit better than serde_json in every benchmark, but these two consistently trailed behind all the other frameworks (in some cases, very considerably behind).\nProst\nProst was the chosen representative for protobuf-style serialization. Its performance was average-to-lackluster on every benchmark, with the exception of the log size benchmark. It beat out postcard, which consistently performed extremely well in the size/zlib categories. This shows just how much the format was optimized for stringy data and minimizing wire size.\nbincode / postcard\nDespite being completely different libraries, bincode and postcard had very similar benchmark results. Serialize and deserialize speed were very close for both of them, and the main difference between the two was usually the final size. Postcard consistently beat bincode on size and zlib. I suspect that they are using very similar techniques, but that postcard has a few more tricks up its sleeve that don't cost much to perform but give it a sizeable advantage.\nCap'n Proto\nCap'n Proto had a good showing, and it proved its worth as a replacement for protobuf. Compared to prost, it was faster to serialize, and supported comparatively fast zero-copy deserialization. These two features are absolutely killer. Unfortunately, it didn't stack up nearly as well against the other zero-copy frameworks. It consistently had disapointing access and read times compared to its competitors, and failed pretty miserably on the mesh size benchmarks. This makes sense as it wasn't built to handle large amounts of raw data, but it was disappointing to see so much wasted space compared to FlatBuffers.\nFlatBuffers\nFlatBuffers is the comparison point for zero-copy deserialization. It's got a lot of usage, was built specifically for performance, and proves out the zero-copy concept. It did well in all categories on most of the tests, but had a major stumbling block. In the minecraft_savedata test, its serialization performance was by far the worst, even worse than serde_json (which had to write twice as much data!). This highlights a major weakness of FlatBuffers: its very poor serialization performance on highly-structured data. It's possible (even probable) that I wrote this bench more poorly than it could be, but it's enough that I wouldn't recommend its use for general-purpose data.\nAbomonation\nAbomonation was definitely a bright spot in the benchmarks. It proved out its insanely fast serialization on every bench, and didn't suffer from some of the size traps that its competitors fell into. It would be an easy library to recommend if it didn't come with so many caveats. It's very unsafe, non-portable, requires mutable backing to access its data, and doesn't support mutations. Nonetheless, abomonation was a really impressive contender in every benchmark.\nrkyv\nI went into these benchmarks not knowing how rkyv would perform relative to its peers, but confident that it would make a good showing. It ended up doing much better than I expected. It won nearly every performance category, and was highly competitive with the winner when it didn't. It also did so without compromising on size, where it was also highly competitive. Finally it showed exceptional scalability, peforming equally well on all different kinds of data where its zero-copy competitors all hard shortcomings on one or more of the data sets. Unlike abomonation, it's also a safe, highly-portable format that doesn't need mutable backing and has more feature support than other competitors.\nConclusion\nI welcome and encourage anyone to run the benchmarks for themselves and open pull requests to improve or clean up whatever they want. I am confident in the validity of these results, and will happily update the tables as changes are made. I will update my analyses if there are any major changes.\nMy hope is that this article not only convinced you that rkyv is one of the best-performing serializers available, but that it also helped you understand the relationships between the different serialization solutions available in rust today.\nIf you're interested in rkyv, I encourage you to contribute to the request for feedback for planning its future\nThanks to burntsushi for the article title inspiration\n","id":"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/rkyv-is-faster-than/","title":"rkyv is faster than {bincode, capnp, cbor, flatbuffers, postcard, prost, serde_json}"},"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/ssg-with-zola/":{"body":"I'm a big fan of Rust\nAnd so are a lot of other people. There's a lot to love about the language, build system, and packages available. But what really brings it home is the community around the language and how they approach programming. In general, the Rust community seems to strike a good balance between purity and pragmatism. Maybe it's because of what the language was built to do, or maybe it's a copy and paste of Mozilla internal culture, but either way it means that Rust makes really good tools. You might have heard of ripgrep, but you probably haven't heard of Zola.\nZola is a small static site generator that was originally called Gutenberg and is written in Rust. Its key features are:\n\nNo dependencies: it's just a single executable, perfect for embedding in repositories.\nBlazing fast: the average site generation time is well under a second.\nFully featured: has support for robust HTML templating with Tera Templates - another Rust project - and compiles Sass and Markdown for you.\n\nIf this piques your interest already, then I'd suggest you go grab the latest release and follow along.\nGetting started\nZola init\nMaking a new site project is incredibly easy - just run:\nzola init my_site\n\nand it will create a new directory named my_site with the right directory structure set up and ready to go. Just change into the new directory and keep going from there:\ncd my_site\n\nZola build\nBuilding the site is as simple as running:\nzola build\n\nand it will build the entire site into a new directory named public. This is how the final build of the site is made; copying the public directory to a simple file server is all you need to do to deploy.\nZola serve\nFor development, Zola comes with a development server built-in. Run:\nzola serve\n\nand it will continuously:\n\nWatch content, styles, and templates for changes\nRebuild the site on the fly\nRefresh the page through an injected script\n\nThis makes for a really great iteration loop since you don't have to constantly switch back and forth between your text editor and browser to refresh it. For obvious reasons, you shouldn't use use the Zola server to serve your final build.\nBuilding blocks\nPages and Sections\nZola is built on the idea that a site is compsed of pages and sections arranged in a tree structure.\nPages are leaf nodes on your site map, and they're meant to contain most or all of your content. Examples include blog posts and informational pages.\nSections are branch nodes on your site map, and they're meant to direct the user to the pages that they're interested in. Examples include directories that list out blog posts and link to them.\nThe content directory in a Zola project defines how the site is structured. Each directory defines a new section1 and the Markdown files inside of it are the pages that are children of that section2. This is why your root index page at my-site.com is a section: it contains all of the other sections and pages in the site.\nTemplates\nZola uses Tera Templates for page templating. They have a lot more documentation about the templating engine on their site, so I'll cover mainly how the Tera works with Zola.\nZola will look in the templates directory for HTML templates to apply to the Markdown files in the content directory. There are three main special templates:\n\nsection.html is applied to all sections.\npage.html is applied to all pages.\nindex.html is a special section template applied to the root section instead of section.html.\n\nZola will take all the metadata about sections and pages that it has available, and expose it through a section or page object to the template. The Markdown for the section or page can be injected into the template through either {{ section.content }} or {{ page.content }}.\nSass\nZola automatically compiles any Sass files directly under the sass directory into CSS files. Sass is a great set of extensions to CSS that make it easier to write and maintain your styles. I ended up mostly leveraging its variables, but there are a lot of other quality-of-life features and powerful styling tools that make it a joy to use.\nStatic content and Assets Colocation\nFiles placed in the static directory will be copied over as-is to the compiled site, so it's a good place to put content that will be used across the entire site.\nZola also supports \"assets colocation\", which is a fancy way of saying that if you put non-Markdown files under the content directory, they'll be copied over right next to other Markdown files' compiled HTML pages. This makes it really easy to organize pages that require custom assets like images and javascript files.\nConclusion\nAfter working with Zola for a while, the overall experience has been very pleasant. At first I found Zola's notion of sections and pages and little unintuitive, but I think that part of that is due to some confusing wording in their site's documentation. It was really easy to set up and the iteration loop is fast and efficient. While it's still a bit rough around the edges3, I can definitely recommend it for anyone looking to make a site like mine.\n1 For all sections except the top-level index, you also need to add an _index.md.\n2 With the exception of any _index.md files.\n3 I had problems with the built-in pagination functionality. It seems like it either doesn't work right or I don't understand it and the docs are too sparse. The server works pretty well for content serving, but every once in a while I managed to crash it with some syntax errors. The system that refreshes the browser page when the server rebuilds content also seems to mess up every once in a while, but restarting the server fixes it.\n","id":"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/ssg-with-zola/","title":"Static Site Generation with Zola"}},"docInfo":{"https://davidkoloski.me/":{"body":25,"title":2},"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/anima-playground/":{"body":27,"title":2},"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/anima-puzzles/":{"body":3,"title":2},"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/intelligent-brute-forcing/":{"body":1246,"title":3},"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/rkyv-architecture/":{"body":956,"title":3},"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/rkyv-is-faster-than/":{"body":1013,"title":9},"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/ssg-with-zola/":{"body":550,"title":4}},"length":8},"lang":"English"};
