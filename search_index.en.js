It's deeply integrated into the language and has a lot of neat features with the new v0.2.0 release.\nI originally released and posted about rkyv in the rust subreddit and got a lot of great feedback. Along with a couple highly desired features, many people asked for a blog post about the design and internals of rkyv. This blog post should serve as a jumping-off point to understand rkyv and zero-copy deserialization in general.\nZero-copy deserialization\nZero-copy deserialization is a technique used to reduce memory consumption and eliminate work when reading from disk or another external source. This isn't really a precise term, since serde has support for zero-copy deserialization, but a very different kind than rkyv. Zero-copy deserialization is more of an umbrella term for techniques that use some of the data from the source and therefore don't copy it when deserializing, hence the name.\nTo be more precise, rkyv implements total zero-copy deserialization. All of the output of deserialization is borrowed from the input and no work is required to transform it from the external (on-disk) representation to the in-memory one. In practice, this means that you can do things like mmap files into memory and use them without deserialization. This is a technique that is sometimes used in the game industry, where performance requirements are very strict. Total zero-copy deserialization can drastically reduce load times which translates directly into a better user experience.\nrkyv architecture\nThis is where we can start getting into the meat and potatoes of rkyv. The first thing to understand about rkyv is relative pointers.\nRelative pointers\nThe first hurdle for total zero-copy deserialization is that regular pointers are not serializable. A pointer is just some address in memory, and that means that it might not even be a valid location for your program on a subsequent run. Even if we could get all of our data back into memory, we would still have to fix up the pointers so they point to the right locations.\nRelative pointers are a technique where instead of writing an absolute pointer to disk (which wouldn't come back pointing to the right place), we instead write an offset to some memory. That offset essentially points to \"the address of this plus some bytes\". A simple example of a relative pointer to a string is these bytes:\n0x0000    04 00 00 00 68 65 6c 6c\n0x0008    6f 20 77 6f 72 6c 64 21\n...\n\nWe'll assume that our relative pointers use 32-bit offsets. The first four bytes of the archive are the relative pointer, which encodes the offset to the string. The first four bytes are 04 00 00 00, which is four on little endian machines. This means that the data is located four bytes forward from the address of the offset. Since the offset is located at 0x0000, we should look for the data at 0x0000 + 4 = 0x0004!\nTaking a peek at that location reveals some bytes that look like ASCII, but we don't know how many yet! Along with the data for the bytes of a string, we also need to encode the length of the string. Let's update our example:\n0x0000    08 00 00 00 0c 00 00 00\n0x0008    68 65 6c 6c 6f 20 77 6f\n0x0010    72 6c 64 21 cd cd cd cd\n...\n\nNow there's two four-byte values: first the relative pointer and second the string length. The relative pointer now has bytes 08 00 00 00, four more than before since we now need to skip over the string length bytes. So the data is now located at 0x0000 + 8 = 0x0008. The length bytes tell us there should be 12 bytes at that location. Reading off the first 12 bytes from there gives us \"hello world!\"! Success!\nIn order to map those bytes into a structure in memory, we might put our ArchivedString together like this:\npub struct ArchivedString {\n    ptr: i32,\n    len: u32,\n}\n\nimpl ArchivedString {\n    pub fn as_bytes(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;[u8] {\n        unsafe {\n            let ptr = (self as *const Self)\n                .cast::&lt;u8&gt;()\n                .add(self.ptr);\n            slice::from_raw_parts(ptr, self.len as usize)\n        }\n    }\n\n    pub fn as_str(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;str {\n        unsafe {\n            str::from_utf8_unchecked(self.as_bytes())\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThe reality is just a little bit more complicated than this, but this is pretty close to the same code you can find in rkyv right now. The general idea behind rkyv is to take build these structures for all of our types so that we can serialize them out and get them back later without having to deserialize.\nArchiving dependencies\nThe next problem we have to tackle is actually creating those relative pointers. In order to make one, we need to know the locations of both the target memory and the relative pointer itself. This is a problem; how can we know where the relative pointer should point if we haven't written it yet?\nImagine that we had some struct that had two strings in it:\nstruct Pair {\n    key: String,\n    value: String,\n}\n\nIt's archived version would look like this:\nstruct ArchivedPair {\n    key: ArchivedString,\n    value: ArchivedString,\n}\n\nIn order to make our archived pair, we have to write the bytes of the key and value first, then construct the relative pointers for the strings. Let's brainstorm roughly what that would look like:\nimpl Pair {\n    fn archive(&amp;self, writer: &amp;mut Write) -&gt; ArchivedPair {\n        let key_pos = writer.write(self.key.as_bytes());\n        let value_pos = writer.write(self.value.as_bytes());\n\n        let base = writer.pos();\n\n        let key_off = offset_of!(ArchivedPair, key);\n        let value_off = offset_of!(ArchivedPair, value);\n        ArchivedPair {\n            key: ArchivedString::new(\n                base + key_off,\n                key_pos,\n                self.key.len()\n            ),\n            value: ArchivedString::new(\n                base + value_off,\n                value_pos,\n                self.value.len()\n            ),\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nRight off the bat, we've introduced some new concepts:\n\noffset_of! is a macro that tells us the offset of a field in our struct. We need to use this to make sure that we're using the positions of the strings within our struct instead of the position of the start of the struct.\nWrite is a writer like std::io::Write that we can write bytes to and which also knows the current position. We need this to get the base for our relative pointers.\n\nThis is a little simplified, but both of these are both concepts used extensively in rkyv. And this works! But what if we wanted to write an array of ArchivedPairs?\nWe've run into a problem!\nWe can write out the first pair just fine, but when write out the second pair we accidentally write our two strings where the second pair should be! Because they're in an array, the archived pairs have to be right next to each other. But there has to be a way around this, this is exactly like how we had to write out the key and value before building our pair!\nTaking a look at the archive function, you can see that the archive process is broken up into two steps:\n\nWrite out the bytes of your dependencies\nGet the current position and figure out your relative pointers using it\n\nThis translates to the two core traits in rkyv: Archive and Resolve. The first step is handled by Archive and the second is handled by Resolve. So what do these traits do?\nArchive and Resolve\nArchive writes out the dependencies of the type and returns a resolver. A resolver is a struct that contains the extra information we need to make an archived version of our type from the writer position and original value. A string's implementation might look like this:\nimpl Archive for String {\n    type Resolver = usize;\n\n    fn archive(&amp;self, writer: &amp;mut Writer) -&gt; Self::Resolver {\n        let pos = writer.pos();\n        writer.write(self.as_bytes());\n        pos\n    }\n}\n\nimpl Resolve for String {\n    type Archived = ArchivedString;\n\n    fn resolve(\n        &amp;self,\n        pos: usize,\n        resolver: usize\n    ) -&gt; Self::Archived {\n        ArchivedString {\n            ptr: RelPtr::from_to(pos, resolver),\n            len: self.len(),\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nIn the archive step, we write out the bytes for the string and return the position those bytes were written to. In the resolve step, we take that position and make a new relative pointer that points to them. Now if we wanted to archive an array of strings, we can archive them all and then resolve them all.\nOnce again, this is very simplified for the sake of example. But the real implementations of these are not too different!\nrkyv provides archived versions of core and standard library types for you out of the box, but you still need to provide them for your own types. That's why rkyv also provides a handy derive macro that does all the heavy lifting for you! Just add #[derive(Archive)] to your type and rkyv will generate an archived type, resolver, and implementations of Archive and Resolve automagically.\nExtending rkyv\nBeing able to archive types made out of library types is enough functionality for some, but there are a few holes in our system that we need to plug up.\nThe first trait is ArchiveRef, which is like Archive for unsized types. Instead of resolving to an archived version of themselves, they instead resolve to a something that dereferences to the archived type. A good way to think about this is that ArchiveRef is Archive for unsized types which use wide pointers with extra associated data.\nThis allows us to implement Archive for types like Box, which needs to be able to archive unsized types like slices and str's. We can also archive our own unsized types with things like trailing slices, even though they're pretty uncommon in practice.\nThe last hole we need to plug is trait objects. Unfortunately this one is pretty complicated, so if you're really interested in how trait object archiving works, I would recommend you look at some of the source for rkyv_dyn, the crate that adds trait object serialization to rkyv.\nConclusion\nEven though this overview is pretty basic, it gives a relatively complete overview of how rkyv works internally. The core ideas are pretty simple, the complicated part is really just writing the core and std implementations.\nIf you weren't interested in rkyv before and are now, try it out and see how you like it! I just shipped a shiny new version with some great new features including validation and mutable archives. You can find the source on github for more information.\nThanks for reading!\n","id":"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/rkyv-architecture/","title":"rkyv architecture and internals"},"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/ssg-with-zola/":{"body":"I'm a big fan of Rust\nAnd so are a lot of other people. There's a lot to love about the language, build system, and packages available. But what really brings it home is the community around the language and how they approach programming. In general, the Rust community seems to strike a good balance between purity and pragmatism. Maybe it's because of what the language was built to do, or maybe it's a copy and paste of Mozilla internal culture, but either way it means that Rust makes really good tools. You might have heard of ripgrep, but you probably haven't heard of Zola.\nZola is a small static site generator that was originally called Gutenberg and is written in Rust. Its key features are:\n\nNo dependencies: it's just a single executable, perfect for embedding in repositories.\nBlazing fast: the average site generation time is well under a second.\nFully featured: has support for robust HTML templating with Tera Templates - another Rust project - and compiles Sass and Markdown for you.\n\nIf this piques your interest already, then I'd suggest you go grab the latest release and follow along.\nGetting started\nZola init\nMaking a new site project is incredibly easy - just run:\n$ zola init my_site\n\nand it will create a new directory named my_site with the right directory structure set up and ready to go. Just change into the new directory and keep going from there:\n$ cd my_site\nZola build\nBuilding the site is as simple as running:\n$ zola build\n\nand it will build the entire site into a new directory named public. This is how the final build of the site is made; copying the public directory to a simple file server is all you need to do to deploy.\nZola serve\nFor development, Zola comes with a development server built-in. Run:\n$ zola serve\n\nand it will continuously:\n\nWatch content, styles, and templates for changes\nRebuild the site on the fly\nRefresh the page through an injected script\n\nThis makes for a really great iteration loop since you don't have to constantly switch back and forth between your text editor and browser to refresh it. For obvious reasons, you shouldn't use use the Zola server to serve your final build.\nBuilding blocks\nPages and Sections\nZola is built on the idea that a site is compsed of pages and sections arranged in a tree structure.\nPages are leaf nodes on your site map, and they're meant to contain most or all of your content. Examples include blog posts and informational pages.\nSections are branch nodes on your site map, and they're meant to direct the user to the pages that they're interested in. Examples include directories that list out blog posts and link to them.\nThe content directory in a Zola project defines how the site is structured. Each directory defines a new section1 and the Markdown files inside of it are the pages that are children of that section2. This is why your root index page at my-site.com is a section: it contains all of the other sections and pages in the site.\nTemplates\nZola uses Tera Templates for page templating. They have a lot more documentation about the templating engine on their site, so I'll cover mainly how the Tera works with Zola.\nZola will look in the templates directory for HTML templates to apply to the Markdown files in the content directory. There are three main special templates:\n\nsection.html is applied to all sections.\npage.html is applied to all pages.\nindex.html is a special section template applied to the root section instead of section.html.\n\nZola will take all the metadata about sections and pages that it has available, and expose it through a section or page object to the template. The Markdown for the section or page can be injected into the template through either {{ section.content }} or {{ page.content }}.\nSass\nZola automatically compiles any Sass files directly under the sass directory into CSS files. Sass is a great set of extensions to CSS that make it easier to write and maintain your styles. I ended up mostly leveraging its variables, but there are a lot of other quality-of-life features and powerful styling tools that make it a joy to use.\nStatic content and Assets Colocation\nFiles placed in the static directory will be copied over as-is to the compiled site, so it's a good place to put content that will be used across the entire site.\nZola also supports \"assets colocation\", which is a fancy way of saying that if you put non-Markdown files under the content directory, they'll be copied over right next to other Markdown files' compiled HTML pages. This makes it really easy to organize pages that require custom assets like images and javascript files.\nConclusion\nAfter working with Zola for a while, the overall experience has been very pleasant. At first I found Zola's notion of sections and pages and little unintuitive, but I think that part of that is due to some confusing wording in their site's documentation. It was really easy to set up and the iteration loop is fast and efficient. While it's still a bit rough around the edges3, I can definitely recommend it for anyone looking to make a site like mine.\n1 For all sections except the top-level index, you also need to add an _index.md.\n2 With the exception of any _index.md files.\n3 I had problems with the built-in pagination functionality. It seems like it either doesn't work right or I don't understand it and the docs are too sparse. The server works pretty well for content serving, but every once in a while I managed to crash it with some syntax errors. The system that refreshes the browser page when the server rebuilds content also seems to mess up every once in a while, but restarting the server fixes it.","id":"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/ssg-with-zola/","title":"Static Site Generation with Zola"}},"docInfo":{"https://davidkoloski.me/":{"body":25,"title":2},"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/rkyv-architecture/":{"body":956,"title":3},"https://davidkoloski.me/blog/ssg-with-zola/":{"body":550,"title":4}},"length":4}};
