		<div class="problemstatement">
			<p>A submarine is moving along the integer number line at a constant speed <em>s</em> so that at each hour it is on an integer number. It started moving at time <em>0</em> at some position <em>b</em>. If <em>t</em> is the (whole) number of hours elapsed since the submarine started moving, then its position is given by the equation <em>x = st + b</em>, where <em>x</em>, <em>s</em>, and <em>b</em> are integers.</p>
			<p>You are working at Rocket Pizza delivery and you are to deliver pizza to the submarine. At each hour you can drop pizza on any number on the integer line. If the submarine is there at that time, then you have delivered the pizza and your job is done (you will be notified as soon as it happens).</p>
			<p>The problem is that you don't know where the submarine is, you cannot see it, you don't know where it started and how fast it is moving (i.e., you don't know values of <em>s</em> and <em>b</em> - classified top secret data). The upside is that you have an infinite number of pizzas.</p>
			<p>Show that you can deliver pizza in a finite amount of time.</p>

			<p>The key to this problem is finding a bijection from the time <em>t</em> to every possible sub (<em>s</em>, <em>b</em>). Once a bijection is found, it's evident that each sub (<em>s</em>, <em>b</em>) has a corresponding time <em>t</em> that its pizza will be delivered at.</p>
			<p>For this mapping, we will consider <em>t</em> a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairing_function#Cantor_pairing_function">Cantor Paired</a> integer. Because <em>b</em> and <em>s</em> can be negative, we'll need to apply an additional bijection from the integers to the natural numbers.</p>
			<p>Given <em>b</em>, <em>s</em>, map them to the natural numbers with the formula <em>n(z) = {2 * z if z &gt;= 0; -2 * z - 1 if z &lt; 0}</em>. Then Cantor Pair them together to determine the time when pizza will be delivered to that sub. The coordinates will be <em>x = b + s * t</em>.</em>
			<p>Given <em>t</em>, unpair <em>t</em> and map the natural numbers to the integers to get <em>b</em> and <em>s</em>. The position to deliver to is equal to <em>x = b + s * t</em>.</p>
			<p>We have therefore established a bijection between the subs and times, and shown that each sub will have pizza delivered to it in a finite amount of time. QED</p>
