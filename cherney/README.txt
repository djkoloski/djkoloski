Cherney, named after a teacher I made the game for, was my best attempt at making a fun educational game. As
is well-known, it's difficult to find a truly fun and compelling educational game. Made for browser use to
ensure compatibility and speed of development, Cherney is a fun, customizable educational review game for
teachers to use with their students. The game came out to be very fun, competitive, and places an emphasis on
learning the material as the best way to win an advantage.

To set up the game, the number of questions per round and the amount of time (in seconds) to allow for each
question is set and an XML file with questions and answers. Each answer to a question can be given a number
of points it's worth, so that partial credit for answers can be given.

The game is fairly straightforward: each of the two sides (red and blue) have a base castle on a grid from which
they can build units. Units can move and attack other units in a rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock fashion, with
each of the units able to kill two other units and killed by two other units. When built, units cannot immediately
move, but can attack, and can only be built within one tile of your base. At the beginning of each turn, units
are given the ability to move. Once a unit is directly to the top, right, left, or bottom of another unit, it may
attack it. Note that the positions for attacking are different from the positions for moving. The dominance order is
as follows:
	Ship beats Zephyr and Crab
	Zephyr beats Octopus and Serpent
	Octopus beats Crab and Ship
	Crab beats Serpent and Zephyr
	Serpent beats Ship and Octopus
There are three additional special rules that apply when two units of the same side are within one square of each other:
	Ships next to Zephyrs can move up to two squares in any combination of directions.
	Octopus next to Ships have protection from Serpents.
	Serpents next to Crabs have double range when attacking.
When a unit attacks an enemy base, it is destroyed directly afterward. To destoy an enemy's base, attack it twice
within the same turn. If you do, you'll win!

At the beginning of each player's turn, a short quiz based on the settings given at the beginning of the game will be
given. Once completed, a number of action points will be awarded based on how many questions were answered correctly.
Action points are used to build units and attack with units. Some units cost more than others, but all cost 1 action
point to attack. Moving units does not require action points.
The build button is signified by a hammer and anvil, the move button by an arrow and target, the attack button by two
crossed swords, and the end-of-turn button by two circling arrows.
To attack, select the monster to attack with, then click the attack button. Finally, click the monster to attack and press
the target button. To cancel, press the cancel button.
Similar targeting schemes work for the build and move buttons.

Once again, enjoy the game!
